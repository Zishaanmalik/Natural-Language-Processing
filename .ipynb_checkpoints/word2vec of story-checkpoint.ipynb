       "'The Longest Text Ever!\\nI am going to do it. I have made up my mind. These are the first few words of the newâ\\x80¦ the best â\\x80¦ the Longest Text In The Entire History Of The Known Universe! This Has To Have Over 35,000 words the beat the current world record set by that person who made that flaming chicken handbooky thingy. I might just be saying random things the whole time I type in this so you might get confused a lot. I just discovered something terrible. autocorrect is on!! no!!! this has to be crazy, so I will have to break all the English language rules and the basic knowledge of the average human being. I am not an average human being, however I am special. no no no, not THAT kind of special ;). Why do people send that wink face! it always gives me nightmares! it can make a completely normal sentence creepy. imagine you are going to a friendâ\\x80\\x99s house, so you text this: [ see you soon ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 ] seems normal, right? But what is you add the word semi to that colon? (Is that right? or is it the other way around) what is you add a lorry to that briquettes? (Semi-truck to that coal-on) anyway, back to the point: [ see you soon ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 ]THAT IS JUST SO CREEPY! is that really your friend, or is it a creepy stalker watching your every move? Or even worse, is it your friend who is a creepy stalker? maybe you thought it was your friend, but it was actually your fri end (let me explain: you are happily in McDonalds, getting fat while eating yummy food and some random dude walks up and blots out the sun (he looks like a regular here) you canâ\\x80\\x99t see anything else than him, so you canâ\\x80\\x99t try to avoid eye contact. he finishes eating his cheeseburger (more like horseburgher(I learned that word from the merchant of Venice(which is a good play(if you can understand it(I can cause I got a special book with all the words in readable English written on the side of the page(which is kinda funny because Shakespeare was supposed to be a good poet but no-one can understand him(and heâ\\x80\\x99s racist in act 2 scene1 of the play too))))))) and sits down beside you , like you are old pals (youâ\\x80\\x99ve never met him before but he looks like he could be in some weird cult) he clears his throat and asks you a very personal question. â\\x80\\x9ccan i have some French fries?â\\x80\\x9d (I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why there called French fries when Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never seen a French person eat fries! all they eat it is stuff like baguettes and crÃªpes and rats named ratty-two-ee which is a really fun game on the PlayStation 2) And you think {bubbly cloud thinking bubble} â\\x80\\x9cHahahahahhahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehhehehehehâ\\x80¦..heeeheehe..heheâ\\x80¦ sigh. I remember that i was just about to eat one of my fries when I noticed something mushy and moist and [insert gross color like green or brown] on the end of one of my fries! now I can give it to this NERD!! â\\x80\\x9d (yes he is a nerd because all he does all day is watch the extended editions of the hobbit, lord of the rings and star wars and eat fat cakes (what the heck is a fat cake? I think it might be like a Twinkie or something)and twinkies(wow so is doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really matter which is which because he eats both(i may have just done that so I didnâ\\x80\\x99t have to Google what a fat cake is (right now I am typing on my iPhone 3gs anyway, which has a broken antenna so i canâ\\x80\\x99t get internet anyway (itâ\\x80\\x99s actually a really funny story that iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you sometime)))and sit in his man cave with his friend named Joe (an ACTUAL friend, not a fri end)and all Joe does is watch sports like football with bob and all bob does is gamble ferociously (donâ\\x80\\x99t ask(it means he buys all those bags of chips that say â\\x80\\x9cwin a free monkey or something if you find a banana in your bag*â\\x80\\x9d(if there is a little star it means there is fine print so I always check the back of the package) *flips over the package* okay, it says: â\\x80\\x9cone of our workers accidentally threw a banana in the packing machine and we donâ\\x80\\x99t want to get sued so we did this promotion thingâ\\x80\\x9d cool. Oh wow, this is salt and vinegar! my favourite! i hate cheese and onion.))and thatâ\\x80\\x99s pretty much his life, he lives in Jamaica with Naruto and his friends) so you give him that gross fri end he throws up all over you and me and the worker behind the counter who was still making an onion, and THAT is the story of the fri end, not a friend who somehow remembered your name and your phone number / email so he could text you saying he would come to your house soon. *finally takes a breath after typing a few hundred words about fri-ends* so what now? i know, i know, you think i ramble too much and use too many brackets (i donâ\\x80\\x99t) but now i am going to talk about my amAZEing day. first i woke up, ate choco pops for breakfast even tho i always hate it when people say that cause i get jealous and super hungry. then iâ\\x80¦ ummâ\\x80¦ yea! that was my day. you know that other person i mentioned before? that flaming chicken person? WELL. i will steal something from that person but do it better. i willâ\\x80¦ drum roll please â\\x80¦ badabadabadabadabadabadabummmmmmmmmmmchshchshchshchshbadabadboumboumpoopoopichypichypichypowpow-crash! *a drum roll was just playing in the background* that drumroll was so long i forget what i was talking about. *scrolls up to see what he was writing about* oh yea! i will make my own FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK! what things do i like? instead of flaming it could be rainbow, instead of chicken it could be fluffysheep and instead of handbook it could be handbook (not very creative, i know) but the total complete name is now to rainbow fluffysheep handbook! to make life easier for you guys, instead of taking random rules out of book willy nilly, i will take them out using my favourite numbers! so, section 5040 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that the king of all oddly coloured farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to tell you any part out of this book randomly or if it is his one of his favorite numbers! 5040 is a great number because it is divisible by 60 integers which i donâ\\x80\\x99t know. iâ\\x80\\x99m tired. it is 10:41 and i am getting sleepyâ\\x80¦ hey hey hey! an intruder! remember that from pokepals rulers of time and darkness or something like that! with piplup and sunflora and chimchar! whaoh piplup is really hard to write on a tiny qwerty keyboard! try it! i realised that asdf is actually written in order on the qwerty keyboard! (just in case you didnâ\\x80\\x99t know, asdf is an amazing short video clips cartoony thing on youtube i first learned bout on flipnote hatena, which is now shut down ð\\x9f\\x98¦ ) what if one day they get rid of the qwerty keyboard completely! i will type it out for you just in case one day they get rid of it. qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm. there u go. Goodbye. Iâ\\x80\\x99m back! i decided that i should tell you about fonts. i always used the same font for my whole life, called arial. the reason is probably because it is on the top of the list in alphabetical order, and i was too lazy to scroll all the way down. only a few months ago did i finally decide to change my mind. i scrolled for what seemed to be an eternity, and i finally got toâ\\x80¦ are you ready â\\x80¦ arial black. yep, that was my big SCROLLING ADVENTURE! just yesterday, i was typing something on google docs and i found the new best font : roboto. its great! i could choose from FIVE different thicknesses. isnâ\\x80\\x99t that amazing? right now we are driving behind a really slow â\\x80\\x9cfarm plastics collectionâ\\x80\\x9d semi. i think i know someone obsessed with pokemon, but i canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you who it is. he keeps making pokepals references and stuff. wow! you are a very loyal reader! if you have REALLY made it this far then youâ\\x80¦ get a gold star on your loyalty chart! good job! this is looking to be the longest text ever, considering that this was all written in one day. i donâ\\x80\\x99t understand sandwiches. if you were to eat bread, mayo and tomatoes separately it would be disgusting! you know all those fancy magazines/restaurants that always have really fancy food pictures with meat and brussels sprouts and all the old people say â\\x80\\x9cwow! that looks great!â\\x80\\x9d and you think {bubble thing} â\\x80\\x9cit looks like the worst thing anyone could ever eatâ\\x80\\x9d and the you eat it and it tastes surprisinglyâ\\x80¦ WORSE than you imagined! gotta goâ\\x80¦ im back! ive ive got stuff to say! your probably thinkingâ\\x80¦ HoW DoEs He HaVe So MuCh FrEe TiMe?!?! And the answer isâ\\x80¦ i donâ\\x80\\x99t. thatâ\\x80\\x99s right. this isnâ\\x80\\x99t just some SIDE project. iâ\\x80\\x99ve gotta make time to do this if wanna get the world record. for all i know, the flaming chicken opponent who i will refer to from now on as sam (i donâ\\x80\\x99t know why) is probably still adding to her posts. (i think i picked sam because it sounds like ham which is like cooked meat and so is flaming chicken, so you will remember that now ) i am officially going to make a quote from the rainbow fluffysheep handbook of knowledge and prestige (sounds catchy, huh?) . section 777 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook STATES that the king of oddly colored farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to use whatever font he wants to. [now, i know what your thinking reader, that has nothing to do with anything. but it will come in handy someday (maybe)] sam makes me feels sick! im offended! (probably because iâ\\x80\\x99m jealous of how much is written on that website(i dont even know how to make a website)) Iâ\\x80\\x99VE JUST BEEN READING THIS AND I HAVE DISCOVERED A CONSPIRACY! THATâ\\x80\\x99S RIGHT, I AM WORKING FOR DOCTOR SUESS! YES! i will prove it to you. i mentioned ham and sickness so green eggs and ham somehow! (why is he called doctor suess anyway? heâ\\x80\\x99s not even a doctor *citation needed* and his books are kinda dumb! (funny considering iâ\\x80\\x99m the one making that statement)) talking about eggs, arenâ\\x80\\x99t eggs practically unborn chicken membrane? wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be scary if you were casually eating your brembudder (riotous robots reference (wow! serious compilation of alliteration dedication!)) and drinking your tae witâ\\x80\\x99 da guvâ\\x80\\x99na (england doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even have a govna! *citation needed*)(iâ\\x80\\x99m not even racist iâ\\x80\\x99m just quoting an accent of a race) and you go to crack an egg for your brekkie and BOOM! and unborn chicken embryo starts running towards you, picks up a knife and starts screaming â\\x80\\x9cMAMA! MAMA!â\\x80\\x9d you are so scared that you grab the nearest weaponry (a spoon) and poke the hideous beast. it is unaffected. luckily, the govener of Berwick-Upon-Tweed throws a sugar cube directly into the chicks mouth! as you know, sugar is EXTREMELY poisonous to chicken embryos *citation needed* (no more citations!) and you are saved! iâ\\x80\\x99m sick and tired of citations! i will quote from the official rainbow fluffysheep handbook! section 12345679 (all the mathematicians are nodding their heads while the OCD people are twitching nervously in the corner) says that the king of oddly coloured farm animals does not have any obligation to write if a false piece of information needs a citation. great! now i feel like a free person! free i tell you, free! free from the prison cell i call the boundaries of untrue info. i think since im going to be the president of somewhere someday, i should have great speech here it goes: Hello great people of [name of place]! i am here to tell you; I am going to make [name of place] great again! i am going to lower taxes, but increase happiness! i am going to buy dog sweaters and bowls for people with dogs, and do some renovations on peoples tents! yes, this truly is a new era, the era of Epicness And Coolness! {and so, his tale lived on forever, being passed on generation to generation, living vividly in the hearts of the people.(that last bit sounded like the ending of an Asterix comic.)} i will now PROVE that all these things can happen. the first thing i said was that i will make America (i know, i know, i gave it away and told you the name) place grape again. (yes, that is what i said, bear with me here) i hereby DECLARE that every piece of American soil must be covered in vineyards. someone told me i should do that. i think i heard it through the grapevine (bad jokethat nobody understands) the next step is to lower taxes and raise happiness. to lower taxes i will get rid of all hospitals, and spend the taxes all on building fun playgrounds. this in turn, raises happiness (for the kids and for the non-injured if you know what i mean). finally, i will buy dog sweaters (on sale at your local liquidation world!) and dog bowls (just use little human bowls maybe?) and last but not least i will do renos on peoples tents (send chip and joanna from Fixer Upper to all the camping places). and, since all i said was (partial) truth, it will be a great era. anyway, gotttttttttttaaaaaaa ggggoooooo. bbbbbuuuuuuyyyy! im back. i just had thanksgiving while listening to christmas music and it was fun. we had bacon, ham and chicken but no turkey. its fall, but itâ\\x80\\x99s ACTUALLY winter secretly. im watching a funny show. iâ\\x80\\x99m back (even though i never said i was gone so you might be confused) hello loyal reader! if you have gotten this far without SKIMMING THROUGH then you are probably either lying, extremely bored (but not after reading this whole thing!) or VERY and i mean VERY dedicated. or all three. you know those homeless people that sit on the ground and ask for money? i think its all a conspiracy! after all, uow can they afford those dogs, sharpies, cardboard and enough english education to write â\\x80\\x9cneed helpâ\\x80\\x9d? back in the roman times, only the richest, most important people could get things like that! you know the new fad, â\\x80\\x98black surfboardsâ\\x80\\x99? (neither did i until 15 seconds ago) someone related to me thinks they look really cool, i think they are neat but SOMEONE also related to me thinks they are bad because they would get warped. someWHERE ohohohohohohover the rainbowwwwww that reminds me, i was doing my normal thing, when BOOM! i started typing NONSENSE. so here it is, but be warned. its SCARILY NONSENSICAL. HeRe GoEs: The Epicness â\\x80\\x93 Hi how are you? Smells good ya! Think about that buddy (shower time) heheheheHAHAHA well thanks a lot so called buddy. Random things: joe be utterly hatin. Dat be da bomb â\\x80\\x93 Tink about tanking me.

Today the world will be DESTROYED! Mwahahahah! Someday the whole peanut of existence will be chipped into The Edge. But then again, maybe it will be forever remembered as the one who saved the mintrolls from the mighty Orc king, and the one who was forever changed; transformed into a giant floating peanut. hello itâ\\x80\\x99s me i was wondering if after all these years you would like to meet -> hey chow gotta beat chow gotta beat chow Hey HEY____________________W W W W W[]_____/\\\\__<>___/\\\\_____ GEOmetry DAESH One day i want to fie to da MOOOOOON!! aheyhayhoy. soametime the sky looke BLOOE, but it actually YALLOE. af yow cane andarstend dis santanse dan yowr umaizang. somedaaaaaaaaaaaaaay, OVer theRAINBOW, WAY UP HI,Oeâ\\x80\\x99r da skie -> @,|3,[,|),Â£,|=,â\\x82¬,|-|,|,7,|<,|_,/\\\\/\\\\,/\\\\/,[],|*,0-,|~,$,-|-,\\\\_/, \\\\/,\\\\/\\\\/,}{,Â¥,%. |-|Â£||[], /\\\\/\\\\Â¥ /\\\\/@/\\\\/\\\\Â£ |$ |3[]|3|3Â¥. | @/\\\\/\\\\ \\\\/\\\\/|~|-|-|/\\\\/â\\x82¬ |/\\\\/ @ $Â£[|~Â£-|- [[]|)Â£ []/\\\\/|Â¥ @ |-|\\\\_//\\\\/\\\\@/\\\\/ [@/\\\\/ \\\\_//\\\\/|)Â£|~$-|-@/\\\\/|). That was it. i know what your thinking (i think i do at least) but iâ\\x80\\x99m not going to tell you. BURNED! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA FEELS THE BURN! sorry, i had to much sugar ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 gotta go you know bro do. Iâ\\x80\\x99m back! and i gotta new conspiracy for u! you know how EVERY child hates brussels sprouts! this is why i think so. Brussels sprouts were happily growing in their belgiumy home. everyone loved them! they were the chicken nuggets of the vegetable world. when suddenlyâ\\x80¦ DA DADA DA! Hitler comes to Belgium (dont read this if you donâ\\x80\\x99t want to. hitler was happily taking over Austria and Poland when he then decided to take over France but France built a big wall thing to keep him out on the border between france and Germany so all Hitler did was go through Belgium to get to France and THAT is when our story is taking place.) and he makes all the brussles sprouts taste bad simply because he is near them! the Mulligan family is about to go to McRonalds and order 43 brussels sprouts (you would have to have been paying very close attention and know some math to understand that joke) and when they get them (after lots of quarrels with the manager (a bit of a parker square if you ask me (you probably donâ\\x80\\x99t understand that either(if you want to feel like you know all these inside jokes, just look em up on the web! your sure to find the videos made by lumberpile(close enough))))) they taste so bad you throw up everywhere! Hitler may have caused WWII, but he also caused brussels sprouts to taste bad. so there you go. why do they always write WWII? (if you canâ\\x80\\x99t tell, they always write double-u double-u eye eye) wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be more accurate to write WW11 or WW2? If i keep writing at this rate, iâ\\x80\\x99ll beat the world record in no time! i might even print it all off and write a novel! too bad i probably donâ\\x80\\x99t have any readers. hello there non existent reader! i hope you are having fun. and i hope you are not injured cuz of that whole â\\x80\\x98no hospitalsâ\\x80\\x99 conundrum. what else should i talk about? how bout Minecraft? just in case you donâ\\x80\\x99t know, Minecraft is a fun game where you place blocks and stuff and you play with friends and most people who play it are like 10 years old but I not and i still have fun and you canâ\\x80\\x99t judge me because I wanna be an engineer and if I wanna be an engineer then i should probably not waste my time playing games wow that went downhill from benefitting me really quickly. Anyway, I prefer the Redstone side of things (Redstone means wiring and stuff). I build stuff like 5 piston extenders and auto wall builders and calculators and computers (not those stupid computers that use command blocks (just in case you donâ\\x80\\x99t know people, command blocks are like CHEATING THINGS and if I am talking about them i will probably not be happy)) and stuff cause i wanna be an inventor. I also do c++ and make things like search engines, text adventures and cookie clickers! My current BIGGEST project is 600 lines long and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know if thatâ\\x80\\x99s a lot but it sure seems like it to me! (when I was typing in the word lines it auto corrected it to â\\x80\\x98liesâ\\x80\\x99) whatâ\\x80\\x99s with the whole naming appliances fad going on? (There isnâ\\x80\\x99t really one) like that vacuum named â\\x80\\x98Henryâ\\x80\\x99 that I have. I have the box here and it says on it it can twist the top part which I never knew before! I just woke up but the anticipation of whether this whole Henry twist bit this is true is killing me and I think I might wake up just to see if its true. Nahhhhhhhhhhh! This text is getting so long itâ\\x80\\x99s getting laggy just typing on the same notes on my phone! I gotta start a new one. See you in another life, brother (Desmond in Lost reference). iiitttttttttsssss Johnny!

I donâ\\x80\\x99t even remember typing that! Itâ\\x80\\x99s so late a night my eyes are bulging out of my sockets because of the brightness on my phone! Now, I know what your thinking. TURN DOWN THE BRIGHTNESS, KING OF RAINBOWFLUFFYSHEEP! I will tell you why I shall not. Because on an iPhone 3 there is no easy access to get to your brightness. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s for the WIMP. Iâ\\x80\\x99m hardcore. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I Have typed a step by step tutorial on how to change the brightness on an iphone3 for you to read, in the comfort of your own home! (Or wherever your exciting life takes you) 1. Click the button on the top right of the phone to turn it on. 2. Swipe from the left to the right on the bottom of the screen. 3. Type in your password and the phone will unlock to the home screen. 4. Click on the Settings App (Your Almost There!) 5. Click on the â\\x80\\x98Brightness/Wallpaperâ\\x80\\x99 Tab. 6. GOOD JOB! ALL U HAVE TO DO IS SWIPE THE LITTLE BAR THINGY! thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I donâ\\x80\\x99t do that. I donâ\\x80\\x99t have THAT much time. I think. Halloo! Iâ\\x80\\x99m in London and Iâ\\x80\\x99m hangin out! Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m back though. This is extremely frightening. Whenever I type words then my phone reads it out to me. Strange.I just turned it off. Good thing too, since every time i heard it i turned around and punched the wall. Not out of fear for my life because of the impending imminent doom, but out of a pure piqued curiosity. Once you obliterate the wall once, every latter time you lose that satisfying crunch. One thing I have aspired to accomplish for a long time now is to make my own pun-themed conspiracy theory. Here goes: in section number 115132219018763992565095597973971522401 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook (i am very proud of that number by the way(*cue all geeks Laughing hysterically*)) STATES that the shearer of greatness (whoâ\\x80\\x99s that again?) has proof the the solvence of the illuminati (if you solve something, would it be called an act of solvence?) and forherbyshared proclaimences all right to own half of all southern states who share barbeque preferences (none([southern dialect] it ju bring a tear to ma eye knowin tha the founding fathers fought for freedum, anâ\\x80\\x99 fer unitee. Ye still the states Connor decide on a preferred bar bee q sawse :()) even if he does not want them. And now gentlemen and ladies, I will prove once and for all that the illuminati â\\x80¦ Is real. Here goes: So, as everyone knows, the illuminati is represented by the pyramid with an eye in the centre. Do you think that it is merely a COINCIDENCE that the first letter in illuminati is i, and I is pronounced â\\x80\\x98eyeâ\\x80\\x99? I THINK NOT! Letâ\\x80\\x99s continue. What is the first thing you think of when you hear the word pyramid? Exactly! The first thing you think of is Egypt? Nooooo!! Itâ\\x80\\x99s that theyâ\\x80\\x99re big. Duh. So what is the first thing that you would say when seeing a pyramid? â\\x80\\x9cWow thatâ\\x80\\x99s big?â\\x80\\x9d No of course not random audience members indicated by the two line things! You would make the sounds of a mesmerised chimp, like â\\x80\\x9cOoooohâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cAhhhhhhhâ\\x80\\x9d. And I know how these two things are connected! What temperature would it be in Egypt? Hot, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what! So hot that it feels like you are cooking a pan. Ahhhhhhhhhh pan, to be precise! And what county sounds like apan? Japan? Now is it just a COINCIDENCE that that Japanese word for big is â\\x80\\x98Ooâ\\x80\\x99? NOOO!!! These things are all connected, I just donâ\\x80\\x99t fully know how yet. So, we know that the answer has something to do with being big, but what? for these kind of questions, you have to work backwards. I call this method, Reverse Solvency. Anyway, what did the rich (big) people do to the poor (not big) Egyptians around the time that the pyramids were built? Exactly! They sold emâ\\x80\\x99 that sounds like soldier! In French thatâ\\x80\\x99s gendarme! Gender! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what they are trying to tell us! Itâ\\x80\\x99s so obvious, in front of our very EYEs from the beginning! So, what gender is associated with being big! (This is gonna be slightly offensive) Males, obviously! (Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry ð\\x9f\\x98¦ *audience member calls out* donâ\\x80\\x99t be sexist! Sorry, but you have to admit, men are usually fatter than women! â\\x80\\x9cHey, now youâ\\x80\\x99re being sexist to males! We have our rights, you know!!! Chauvinists! Communists! We are great! Who insists? Communists! We will rule with hate!!! â\\x80\\x9d ummm actually I was saying that men are fatter because back in the time of the PYRAMIDS if you were fat you were considered wealthy. â\\x80\\x9cNow your sexist to us again! Feminists rule! Feminists are great! We are going to rule with hate!!â\\x80\\x9d If you both want to rule with hate , just hate each other equally so this can be over with!!!! Thank you. Anyway, back to the conspiracy) Where were we? Oh yes. Men! What word has men in it? Fishermen, of course! Fishermen caught a lot of fish, and what did the Egyptians have a lot of? Gods! Fishermen used to go slow in boats, so we can remove the g forces, and we a left with â\\x80\\x98odâ\\x80\\x99. And where are the fishermen!?!? In the sea! The â\\x80\\x98câ\\x80\\x99! And what kind of fish do they catch? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s right, the â\\x80\\x98Codâ\\x80\\x99! Now, we use are backwards method to come up with â\\x80\\x98Docâ\\x80\\x99. As in a doctor! What does a doctor do? Helps people who are sick! But do you know what the worst thing about doctors is? You still have the pay the doctors fee even if you are not sick! And mind you, the doctors fee is quite a large bill, and I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want to go to the doctor not even for a bee sting! Alas, This is as far as I have gotten. Can anyone help me? Um yes, you? â\\x80\\x9cYes, I was just wondering what Big, men , ooo, not bees, Bills , and sickness have to so with the Illuminati! â\\x80\\x9d wait anonymous audience member say that again! â\\x80\\x9cBut like, it was a lot of wordsâ\\x80\\x9d [the writer remembers that he is not allowed to copy and paste, so he skips the dramatic scene where one character says his sentence again while the Maine character says aha! I think I got it!] â\\x80\\x9cgot what? The flu?â\\x80\\x9d Who the heck are you? And how did you get backstage? Security?!?! SECURITY!!!!! â\\x80\\x9cyes sir?â\\x80\\x9d What are you guys wearing?! â\\x80\\x9cObviously we are wearing tiger skins, for camouflage!â\\x80\\x9d Now I donâ\\x80\\x99t even have security to take all the psychopathic people in here, because my security are psychopathic themselves!!! Annnyyywwwaaayyyâ\\x80¦ I figured it out! Bill, no bee and sick! No bee is actually no â\\x80\\x98Bâ\\x80\\x99, the letter! The only b we have is in bill! And if you take it off, what do you get. â\\x80\\x9cillâ\\x80\\x9d . And what is a synonym for ill. Sick. We have gotten pretty far on our journey of solving the question of the illuminati, although we have not quite accomplished the full desired outcome yet. What did all the most important people in egypt do when they were not prosecuting the poor? They were eating, of course! And what were the poor doing in their spare time? What any law-abiding heartwarming lovely citizens would be doing? Playing Sports, of course? And where are the rich buried? In coffins like boxes. When someone dies, hey eyes turn into 24pt roboto thin-line xâ\\x80\\x99s in italics. Huh; box, x. An XBox of course! And what company makes sports for an Xbox? Electronic arts. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve all heard of â\\x80\\x98E A Sports. Itâ\\x80\\x99s In The Game.â\\x80\\x99.if the rich are â\\x80\\x98eatâ\\x80\\x99 and the poor are â\\x80\\x98eaâ\\x80\\x99 the only letter not used in both is the letter T! As in tea! A tea is going to come in handy. Even the word eat is just an anagram for tea! Itâ\\x80\\x99s all starting to make sense to me now! Itâ\\x80\\x99s all fitting together like the pieces of childâ\\x80\\x99s jigsaw! Remember the plagues on Egypt? One of those must be a clue, but which one!? For this, we need to go back to original illuminati ideas, the eye and the triangle. What number do they have in common? 3, of course! A triangle has three sides! If you asked someone to draw a shape and the only hint you have them as to which shape it is was to tell them â\\x80\\x983â\\x80\\x99, then chances are they would draw a triangle! It even has three in its name â\\x80\\x93 tri-angle! And how many color cones does an eye have? You guessed it, three. And the third plague is: letâ\\x80\\x99s see hereâ\\x80¦ Gnats. What has a gnat got to do with anything? That information is probably gnat even right (LOLZ)! Anyway, letâ\\x80\\x99s keep going, there must be more to discover yet still. Who was the last pharaoh in Egypt? Cleopatra. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s so famous, that there have been books and movies made about her! The movies would have been very old, if they were made when she was alive. So old in fact, that they probably used those old cameras with the crank thingy on the side and the reels. Remember the fishermen from before! They connect! The â\\x80\\x98reelsâ\\x80\\x99! I think we now have all the information we need to prove that the illuminati is real. Lets see, what do we have: ill, oo, men, a tea, is gnat, reel. What happens if we squish them all together. Illoomenateaisgnatreel. Illoomenatea is gnat reel. Oh. Well, good thing we got that cleared up. Guess what peeps? I have made it to 35000 characters! Why is that so significant, you might ask? Because the world record is 35000 words! That means that all I have to do is replace every letter with a word. Like this: instead of writing â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m back!â\\x80\\x99 I could say â\\x80\\x98internet mascara beagle Australia catamaran kipperâ\\x80\\x99 and all you do is read the first letter! This would probably make for some nonsensical blubber, as one might say, but at least iâ\\x80\\x99ll beat the record! Also I have another Up-to-standard word idea to get more writing in! Instead of just writing a normal sentence I replace all the words with their respective dictionary definition! Yes, writer, that is a good awesome cool convenient and simple idea! So here goes: â\\x80\\x98jumping cacti ate many jars containing marmaladeâ\\x80\\x99 -> â\\x80\\x98any of numerous succulent plants of the family Cactaceae, of warm, arid regions of the New World, having fleshy, leafless, usually spiny stems, and typically having solitary, showy flowers that are leaping or springing over an object the past tense of to take into the mouth and swallow for nourishment constituting or formulating a large number of a broad-mouthed container, usually cylindrical and of glass or earthenware currently holding or including within its volume or area a jelly-like preserve in which small pieces of fruit and fruit rind, as of oranges or lemons, are suspended.â\\x80\\x99 Wow, that took longer than I expected. Just so I donâ\\x80\\x99t get sued, I am now informing you that those pieces of information were sourced from a well-designed, helpful and informative website currently named dictionary.com.

Kshhhhhhh thank you for that lovely message from our sponsor, hooey kablooie. I need a topic. Not just any topic that you find on the floor, but a topic so magnifico, so delisimo, and so interestinio, that I that I fall on the ground in a seizure. I got one! This is a short skit entitled: ninjas: explorers of time and space! *intense music builds* yes sensei! I will punch that piece of wood so hard that it creates a wormhole in the 6th dimension! My apprentice, you have trained hard. There is now a one in one times ten to the million chance that using this wormhole will send us to a earth-like planet that will be habitable for all ninjas in the clan of the ninjapeeps. All hail the ninjapeeps! (You donâ\\x80\\x99t actually have to) who said that?! Who would have the audacity to threaten the ninjapeeps all hail the ninjapeeps in such a way! I did. And you are? The Writer. Nice to meet you, my name is senseinohi, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s sensei to you. Howdy pawtna! No, we are actually japanese, not texan. Kong-nae-chae-waw, pawtna! Sensei, donâ\\x80\\x99t respond! Donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember what this man did? No. He was the one who disarmed the hailing of the ninjapeeps all hail the ninja peeps! Oh yes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s right. Sorry dude, but PREPARE TO BE THROWN INTO THE SIXTH DIMENSION, YOU DIRTY RASCAL! The sensei grabbed his handheld torpedo launcher and shot it at The Writer. It hit him and pushed him into the board! Do it! The Apprentice hit the board with all his might, and it broke apart. Not how you would think though, it actually compressed into a wormhole, shifting the spacetime fabric around it! (Now I know what youâ\\x80\\x99re thinking, reader. Donâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x98Theyâ\\x80\\x99 always say to make a story believable!? And to that I sayâ\\x80¦ but it is. You see, if you are a small minded gherkin (hey! You! No insults or weâ\\x80\\x99re going to have to stop this little â\\x80\\x98playâ\\x80\\x99 of yours!) okâ\\x80¦ whatever. You probably believe that when you push something, the far side of it moves instantly, right? WELL YOUâ\\x80\\x99D BE WRONG! Actually, the opposite side of the object moves in the same time it would take for sound to travel from you to it. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s an example: there is a lightning bolt with a hand far away from you. When it strikes the ground, it pushes a meal pole towards you, so one end is in its hand while the other is in yours. You will get pushed back at the exact time you hear to thunder! Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that fabulous? That means that if the ninja punches faster than the speed of sound (a lot faster though) then he will be able to compress the board into a space time warping black hole) The Writer is plunged into the endless oblivion of the cascading incomprehension that is the sixth dimension. Little did the ninja peeps all hail the ninja peeps know, when you are in the sixth dimension, you can teleport right inside people and objects! (It actually depends on what kind of sixth dimension you are in. If you are in a four axes two time dimension, as in this skit, you can moves backwards and forwards in time and change the outcome of time, yet not travel directly to any possible outcome which you may have formed in the past. Also, with another axes under your belt, you can essentially disappear and reappear at will, yet with a time delay, which is nulled due to your cacophony of dimensions, specifically time.) so what The Writer did next was simple! He simply went back in time, and landed inside the sensei, causing him to not be thrown into the wormhole, causing him not to land in the senseiâ\\x80¦ This is making less sense as we go. In the end, the universe gets confused, and tells us a message: universe.exe has stopped responding. Noooooooooooooooo â\\x80\\x94 Yep. And that is what I do with my life essentially. Gotta go now sea ya! Iâ\\x80\\x99m back! With a conspiracy that will blow your minds/mind if you are human! Zooreka is the easiest game to play if you have the slightest bit of mathematical knowledge! When choosing what to roll for, it is sooooo obvious which on the choose using basic knowledge. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not going to tell you, because next time you play it you will figure it out (if you even HAVE zooreka). Now that I think About it, that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t really a conspiracy, was it :(. I have a reward for you reader. If you have truly made it this far thanâ\\x80¦ Give me your email and I will send you the answer to the zooreka challenge, free of charge! Send an email to rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com, inquiring. Also, you can ask me any other important questions you might have! In section 18w08b of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it CLEARLY STATES that the king of oddly colored farm animals (thatâ\\x80\\x99s me!) will reply to ANY email set to the inbox of rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com to the best of his ability (not including spam tho). Hey! I just realised that when I wrote the word color, it get a red squiggle underneath! What a sham! ShamWOW! In section 18o25g02i22 it states that anyone, not only the king of the oddly colored farm animals, is allowed to spell color without a u! Hurrah! Hurrah! Three cheers for the rainbow fluffysheep handbook! (But that was only two, Harold. Whatever.) and that, ladies and gentlemen, was the way Color was born. THE END. Iâ\\x80\\x99m back! And do I have an exciting subject for you! No! I donâ\\x80\\x99t! Ha, gotcha there, didnâ\\x80\\x99t I! Wow, it just started raining. Oh wait, itâ\\x80\\x99s snow! Not just any snow, mind you, but itâ\\x80\\x99s topicsnow! Yay! All these great topics falling softly from the sky. What could be better. Iâ\\x80\\x99m now walking down the street. Hey you! Ye? Is that a topicman? Yes sir, tis! Well ainâ\\x80\\x99t that great. If want to get the best topics, I must climb mt.Big. Hey look, thereâ\\x80\\x99s some kids having a topicball fight! How fun. Noooooo! A topicalanche! (That doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even make sense!!! The word avalanche doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even have the world snow in it! ) Since I died, i didnâ\\x80\\x99t get any topics. Sooooooo yea. *cue awkward elevator music* ding do do ding dong ding do do ding dong. *taps his foot* *hums 90â\\x80\\x99s pop song* grabs chainsaw from behind his ear and cuts the elevator cord, plunging the box of awkwardness in to the darkness of forgetfulness and loss of meaning. Forgetâ\\x80¦ Forgetâ\\x80¦â\\x80¦â\\x80¦.. You drift into a deep dreamless sleep, waking up to an elevator of twisted metal wreckage resembling a dead animal carcasses. Beside is the corpse ofâ\\x80¦ ofâ\\x80¦ an onion?!?! Wow, who knew onions could be so awkward :o. I just read what I wrote and it makes less sense than I thought. Little did you guys know, that today you would get a great piece of text to read. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t even know that. You know that guy from shamWOW! He always said all these great things about that weird sponge? Yea, that was a short topic. Im gone. Im back! Wait, how did i type if i was gone? With my mmmiiiinnnndddddâ\\x80¦ woooooooo creeeeeeeepy! Anyway, this is what i was thinking. I feel really sorry for water molecules! All they do all their lives is slowly get raised up slowly until they land in a cloud with their friends! Wahoo! Or, so you think. In reality, at any moment they could fall to their impending doom! They drop thousands of meters to the ground, only now realizing that they are miles from home!! They take the nearest river trying to get home, before repeating the cycle! They teach us this horror story in kindergarten, masking the brutal morbidity of it by articulating the conundrum using macroscopic convoluted words! Like â\\x80\\x98evaporationâ\\x80\\x99, more like flying up to the sky knowing that itâ\\x80\\x99s your final moment â\\x80\\x93 ation! Condensation!?!? More like con â\\x80\\x93 ned by your kindergarten teacher inti thinking that this means water gently floating to the surface of the earth, when it really means death by lack of parachute! How could you be so â\\x80\\x93 dense â\\x80\\x93 ation! (Public service announcement: this is an anonymous relative spakinâ\\x80\\x99: *where is he? Dunno.* this was test, and only a test. Had this been a real public service announcement then i would have â\\x80\\x93 not been here! Harharhar ! Stop making fun of harold! He was only late for that one clock commercial and now you guy just have to â\\x80\\x93 its OK bob, i donâ\\x80\\x99t care about the Larry squad. They donâ\\x80\\x99t bother me no longer. KK haroldâ\\x80¦.. ummâ\\x80¦ this was a te â\\x80\\x93 wait, did we already do that part? Uh, ya i think soâ\\x80¦. so this is awkward. Ya, sooooooo â\\x80\\x93 *in the echoey distance* cut to the commercial break! What the heck do i pay you for? Toâ\\x80¦ getâ\\x80¦ youâ\\x80¦ coffee, sir. Oh, you the coffee boy? Why the hack did my coffee not have any cream in it yesterday!? I almost burnt my mouth into non-existence! I was told not to put in in, sir. By who? Lets just say i got aâ\\x80¦ Higher Calling. Youâ\\x80¦ you m-m-mean that The Boss called? Yes, budget cuts he said. No more cream he said. No more name-brand cereal! Nooooo if my cereal is packed in a bag i swear on my neighbors cousins dogs bone that i will take every cereal bag, pour out all the cereal, and put them into the boxes that i saved from the name brand cereal!!! Is thisâ\\x80¦ youâ\\x80¦ you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t. Oh, try me. Yea, now that i think about it you probably would do that. Why was i here again? Oh yaâ\\x80¦ CUT TO A COMMERCIAL ALREADY! We donâ\\x80\\x99t have any commercials sir, we got voted unanimously by popular vote not to have any commercials. Well obviously the public didnâ\\x80\\x99t wantâ\\x80¦ didnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80¦ di- it all makes sense now! The budget cut is BECAUSE of us not playing enough commercials! But sir, our quota ends tomorrow! We need to have played 50837 commercials! There is. Only. One. Way. Play all the commercials at 100x speed! Is that even LeGaL?! Of course it is! We might have to have an epilepsy warning at the start though. Donâ\\x80\\x99t people get epilepsy from watching fast images? This is a radio station, so people can just hear it! Ummmâ\\x80¦ this is an earlepsy warning! HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHhahahahhahha hehe heâ\\x80¦ heh. That wasnâ\\x80\\x99t funny, steven.) And back to our regular program. I just started a sentence with a preposition! Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that, like, seven years bad luck or something? Well I can solve that. Section 1 of the Rainbow Fluffysheep handbook says that the king of oddly colored (not coloured like some LOSERS would write) farm animals has full veto to start any sentence with a preponderance. (What the hooey is a preponderance? It says here that it means to be greater than something. Well, the king of oddly colored is full of preponderance towards everyone else! Mwahahaahaha!) Now i can start with a preposition too. Well that worked. (The reason that I used the number 1 is because it has become forgotten among numbers. You see, 1 isnâ\\x80\\x99t considered a prime number! Like what the hey! Its only factors are one and itself!) Do you think that when a particle is beckoned into existence, it uses one of those slot machines with the big arm? And the 777 of the particle world is gettingâ\\x80¦ Hmmmm. I actually have now idea. Maybe just hydrogen! Hydrogen is pretty sweet for blowing people up. But then when your becoming a particle, you have to use it and see what you get. A typical particle would be at one. Here is an example: *cue southern accent* sweat was rolling down my face like the Rolling Stones. I canâ\\x80\\x99t believe it has come to this. I force my hand over to the lever on the side of the machine, which appeared to be taunting me. Itâ\\x80\\x99s lights and horror movie little-kid-singing-or-jackâ\\x80\\x93inâ\\x80\\x93theâ\\x80\\x93box (the reason i did that is because I was putting a space between every word, AND jack-in-the-box already has them too) seemed to violently clash against the darkness and dread of the outside world. I clenched the red metal ball with all my might. It was cold as Alaskan ice on a early winter morning, and its color was the blood of the many particles who had to go through with this also. I jerked my limb backwards, causing the huge metal pole to turn on a skewed axis. It came to a stop after turning a quarter of the way with a hard crack, like the crack of a whip. I refocused my attention to the screen. The cylinders were rolling faster than A grands prix racers tyre. Suddenly, the first one came to an abrupt halt. I stared at it, but struggled to read the letter because of my complete shock. H. It said H. I should have been happy, I know, but I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t completely out of the woods yet. There was a tiny times two symbol beside it. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t care. I pulled the arm again, not knowing what life-changing, devastating thing was to come. It spinning thing that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have a name stopped. O. No. It was the letter O! Now I too will have to live this tortuous fate! Do you think that water parties breathe? Because then, when they did, they would just be hydrogen for a very short amount of time. ENOUGH WITH THE WATER PARTICLES!! I have a conspiracy theory! You know those spinny poles that barbers have? Of course you do! They are probably used to hypnotise people into getting their hair cut there! #subSPINinalmessagesfromcruelbarbers. There is a haircut called â\\x80\\x9cmeet me at McDonaldâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d that is BANNED where I live. goodbye. and rememberâ\\x80¦ barbers are eevviill! Iâ\\x80\\x99m back! Did you know that palm trees arenâ\\x80\\x99t actually trees? Yea, thatâ\\x80\\x99s right, palm TREES!!! I think that theyâ\\x80\\x99re bushes or something. That makes me angry! in section 6.02214129Ã\\x9710^23 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that trees are trees.. no matter how small (Horton hears a who). On a completely unrelated note, there was this old man who painted a baseball like infinite times so now itâ\\x80\\x99s like the size of a truck. I was listening to this amazing radio station and this is ACTUALLY what it was about. I will try to rein-act it as accurately as possible. â\\x80\\x9cRecently, a Russian double-agent was poisoned in England. Also, there was a man who had ten million euros, which he gambled until he got nine million of it back. he was so mad that he didnâ\\x80\\x99t get it all, that he robbed his employers to get the money back. now he is a counsellor for people struggling with a gambling addiction. heâ\\x80\\x99s a great lad, he is, heâ\\x80\\x99s had a great life. By the way, its my mother in laws 100th birthday today! Go over to her house and say hello! I have her post code written on the back of my phone. Also, there was a man who invented the windup radio and the shoe phone charger who died this week.â\\x80\\x9d I know what youâ\\x80\\x99re thinking: thereâ\\x80\\x99s no way this actually happened, right? YES THIS WAS REAL! And I thought it was pretty funny hehehe. I need write all o the funny things that happen in my life in here. So today I was in the library, minding my own business, when I noticed someone was drawing cartoons and there were a whole bunch of little kids surrounding him (Iâ\\x80\\x99m guessing from ages 2-5). Classic movie plot device that never happens in real life, so I was already skeptical. He was drawing a zombie. â\\x80\\x9cAnd now you see, the zombies chin is like a chimpanzees bubblecopter asparagus. (Wait what? Lets try this again) And now you see, the zombies chinos like aâ\\x80¦ Wellâ\\x80¦ A line.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9dwhy does the zombie look like its from the Simpsons?â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9dbecause real zombies are too scary for you kids. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why Iâ\\x80\\x99m not drawing the ones from the walking dead, for example.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9dIâ\\x80\\x99ve seen that movie!â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9dyeah me too!!â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9dumm.. Ok, how many of you guys have seen the walking dead?â\\x80\\x9d*everyone puts their hand up* the only reason I thought that story was funny is because that kind of thing only happens in movies. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s up with the saying, â\\x80\\x98easy as pieâ\\x80\\x99? Like what the hooey! Pie is really hard to make. The pie crust always ends up being soggy.â\\x80\\x99piece of cakeâ\\x80\\x99 is a saying too! Whatâ\\x80\\x99s with all these people that think baking is easy! (Now that I think about it, this is a weird thing to be mad about). Maybe I just need to calm down. NOOOO!!! In section 888 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that the king of oddly colored farm animal (thatâ\\x80\\x99s me!) hereby declares that the sayings â\\x80\\x98easy as pieâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98piece of cakeâ\\x80\\x99 are now changed to â\\x80\\x98easy as breadâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98piece of breadâ\\x80\\x99. I just realised that I was typing with my phone in portrait mode! Now I turned it into landscape and I feel so freeeeeee!!! I need to come up with other things that I do randomlyâ\\x80¦ Like the rainbow fluffysheep hanbooks challenge booklet subset! If I am talking about some random subject, I will now randomly put a challenge for you, the reader (which probably doesnâ\\x80\\x99t exist) to do! Piece of bread! In section 7 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset it STATES that your challenge is: get anyone you know to say piece of bread instead of piece of cake! (They probably wonâ\\x80\\x99t do it unless you tell them the reason (or you have really good friends)) i have to shorten the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset so that I donâ\\x80\\x99t have to write the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset all of the time. From now on, it is considered TRFSHCBS. I probably news to add vowels to pronounce it. And take out â\\x80\\x98theâ\\x80\\x99. RAFLUSHEHACHABOOS. Pronounced ra-fluh-shee-ha-cha-boo-s. thatâ\\x80\\x99ll work. I need to write more to fill my writer quota. That just sounded cool to say. I probably write aboutâ\\x80¦ 100 words a day. Well I started today at the zombie thing, so yea. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s going to be the next big thing in the future? Technically, Iâ\\x80\\x99m writing this in the past, so you guys can email me at rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com and tell me what the futureâ\\x80\\x99s like! The only problem is that I will only receive it in the future. Another one of my BRILLIANT ideas gone down the tubes. Goodbye. The world is unjust! I worked for hours on end, making an app for a coding competition. And then they announcedâ\\x80¦ We made it to the country finals! The COUNTRY! By that time, my app had over 5,000 downloads! It was amazing. But we came in second. Guess what the prize was for second?!?! TAKE A WILD GUESS!!!! NOTHING! This wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been so bad, but at the competition they were giving away free stuff. And GUESS WHO GOT SAID FREE STUFF?!?! MY BROTHER, THATâ\\x80\\x99S WHO!!! So in the end, after spending half the year doing a competition, my brother, who did absolutely nothing, got more out of it then me. The world is unjust! Unfair! Prejudiced! Biased! Fascist! (Wait, that was autocorrected). I just needed to get my anger out. When I wrote autocorrected, it autocorrected it to autocorrect ex! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the last time i buy an apple product. How many devices companies are fruit? Thereâ\\x80\\x99s apple obviously, and blackberry, and pear (Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen pear shops in cities) and raspberries (as in the greatest computer of all time, raspberry pi). That could be the most expensive fruit salad ever! What would you like to order, moisuer? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have the fruit salad. Oui, oui. Harold! That costs $5k! So? I bet itâ\\x80\\x99s good! KSHHH and hereâ\\x80\\x99s how the skit would have went if I had autocorrect on. Why would you like to order, moisture? You guys have moisture in this restaurant? thatâ\\x80\\x99s not up to the code for restaurants. iâ\\x80\\x99ll have to tell the building inspector! Oh yes, anyway, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have the fruit salad. Out, out! Runnnn! Iâ\\x80\\x99m coming Harold! That waiter must have something about fruit salad! Maybe he had a bad experience as a child. Wow, I sure went off on a tangent. Do you think that it would be cool if apple made all their devices different fruit names! The iPad pro could be the watermelon, cause its so big. And the iPhone nano could be the strawberry (other berry names are trademarked) what else? A phone with a lot of space could be the peach, because the pit is like the hard-drive! (That was a bit far fetched) and the MacBook could be an orange because when you open it it it cut in the insideâ\\x80¦ Cuz laptops are like two partsâ\\x80¦ You know? (and if you cut a grape in half and put it in the microwave it will make plasma (just thought youâ\\x80\\x99d like to know that)) Earbuds could be cherries because they always have the two cherries which are like the ear things! And theyâ\\x80\\x99d call the charger â\\x80\\x98The Rootâ\\x80\\x99. Why a great idea! I will let apple use these names and I only need a 0.00000000000001% share In the company. Even though I did work hard at this. I just thought of something amazing! If you are in a shop and you see a jar of nondescript sauces (mayacamole) and it costs two bucks. TWO BUCKS!!! You know for a FACT that the shop just across town sells them for one-fifty. The shop is five minutes away. If you choose to go to the shop, then you my friend are working for minimum wage! (Except in the case that you have to walk back. If so, just buy the mayacamole at the former option( or just get salsa. Itâ\\x80\\x99s on sale! (Which probably means that its old))) wasnâ\\x80\\x99t that interesting? Hereâ\\x80\\x99s another situation. You are buying a $400,000 home (average price right now Iâ\\x80\\x99d say) and you think â\\x80\\x9cwhat a steal!â\\x80\\x9d And your neighbour thinks â\\x80\\x9cwhere did i put that shotgun cartridge again? But is you think about it you are working for 1,667 weeks to pay for that! (Assuming 8 hours a day, five days a week at minimum wage) Thatâ\\x80\\x99s 32 YEARS! Letâ\\x80\\x99s say you work for 12 hours a day, seven days a week for $20 an hour, thatâ\\x80\\x99s still 238 weeks! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s still five years! Just buy a camper van for goodness sake! I just got to thinking; how many tiny changes would a cereal company have to make to earn twice as much from a box of cereal? (Assuming people still bought the same amount ( I think I can trust the general population)) it turns out that if we want to double the profits by decreasing things by ten percent, we would have to do it seven times. Which means instead of selling these cornflakes: Box height: 1 meter; Box length: 1 meter; Box width: 1 meter; Percent of cornflake that is cornflake ( not air): 100%; Percent of box filled with bag: 100%; Percent of bag filled with cornflakes: 100%; Production cost: 10 cents; they could sell these: Box height, width & length: 0.9 meters; Percent of cornflake that is cornflake ( not air): 90%; Percent of box filled with bag: 90%; Percent of bag filled with cornflakes: 90%; Production cost: 9 cents; they would make double the profits! Hooray! Well thatâ\\x80\\x99s that. You know how people always have weird names on the interweb? Well I came up with Internet name generator! (Random adjective)(Random noun)(Use a deck of cards for this part. Take out the jokers and face cards, and tens are now zeros. Pick out numbers until you get a club) additional things include: (pick a card. If it is three or lower, put X at the start and end)(pick a card. If it is an ace, replace noun with random country. If it is a two, replace noun with Internet related company + fan.) let me try this. Here is what I got: FoulSoup31, XxInternalAle10xX, StrengthenedFillet49458, MediocreElectrode20, and EpicRedditFan7515. That was a lot more accurate than I thought it would be. Bye. Hello! I need to rant more! I am going to start a sentence without knowing where it is leading. I wish I could buy a mocha for my clown pants while aliens eat your toes which glisten in the sliver of wind. That was fun. Why is orange so popular? There are SO MANY WORDS that donâ\\x80\\x99t rhyme with other words too, like engine, silver and angry (hangry isnâ\\x80\\x99t a real word as far as I know). And people know that orange rhymes with â\\x80\\x9cdoor hingeâ\\x80\\x9d! Some people say that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t count. But there is another! Sporangia! Well, itâ\\x80\\x99s pretty close. I think itâ\\x80\\x99s like fern spores. Well remember, whenever you see the color orange, type #boycottorange, so people stop taking pictures of orange things. For Halloween, people will carve watermelons instead of pumpkins. Trump will no longer be president because of his orange skin. Oranges (the fruit) will be replaced by reds! (The soon to be fruit). The sun will disappear, or if we want to not go extinct, just change its color to blue. I have a map of Europe on my wall, which has the countries in different colors. BEWARE IF YOU LIVE IN: The UK, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Denmark and Armenia. You guys will soon disappear off the face of the earth. And my favourite pop is club orange! Nooooo! And Jupiter will disappear too! Now that I think about it, losing orange things wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be that bad compared to other colors. Like blue. We would lose water, blue paint, the second book in the Rust comic book series, the sky, Pluto and that one triple angry bird. That would be awful. In section 255 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it STATES that the king of oddly colors farm animals (me again) will never make all blue things disappear, but he may make all orange things disappear. Now you guys donâ\\x80\\x99t have to worry! :)! Why are kings higher than queens in a deck of cards? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s really sexist! People think that king is worth thirteen and queens are worth twelve! (If you canâ\\x80\\x99t tell, Iâ\\x80\\x99m mocking that people that get offended by everything). Why do vegetarians worry about hurting animals, but not plants!?!? Plants have feelings too (I think)! In fact, vegetarians kill MORE than carnivores. Instead of a whole family eating a chicken, if they are all vegetarians, then they will probably kill hundreds of plants! Think about THAT, people! In this whole LoTeEv, I have probably offended a lot of you guys. Sorry bout that. In section 1029384756 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that if the mug of oddly colored farm animals (me again) offends any reader, he is sincerely sorry *citation not needed because of section 12345679 of the RFSH*. Why are the money symbols not consistent? Like thereâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x82¬uros, Â¥en and Â£ounds. But why $ollars? Maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s supposed to be dollar$. That makes more sense. Now I wonâ\\x80\\x99t get that nervous eye twitch every time I see that symbol. â\\x80\\x9cHey look, I just found this ten dollar bill on the ground! Hey why the flop is he doing that?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s justâ\\x80¦ a Thing that he doesâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI have a great idea for this! Whenever he gets near money his eye twitches! That means we can find money on the ground just by watching him!â\\x80\\x9d And thatâ\\x80\\x99s how I lost all my friends. It turns out that was the only reason they liked me. Wait what is this ?? That is so ?eird. Goodbye. Iâ\\x80\\x99m back! Hahahaha gotcha! I was just kidding about that. But you would have never known that! Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to try to make words using only the top row of letters. Hmmmmâ\\x80¦ Lets see. Tip, rip, port, type, write, writer, typewriter. Fascinating. Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to make a fake movie trailer. Using only words. Here we go: [Have you everâ\\x80¦]{scene of old woman churning milk}[wanted toâ\\x80¦]{scene of older woman churning what is now cream(the reason she is older is not because it is a different person, but because we filmed it after}[churn your own butter?!?!]{scene of even older woman churning what is now butter (the reason she is even older is because we got a new actor because the other one retired (she used to put tires on her vehicle, and now she does it again))}[This is a great movie, if you are an IDIOT][â\\x80\\x9cthis is a great movieâ\\x80\\x9d][i had popcorn while I watched this movie, and I really enjoyed it, it soothed the pain of having to watch that movie][â\\x80\\x9cI really enjoyed it, it really soothedâ\\x80\\x9d][i actually really enjoyed the movie!][waitâ\\x80¦ What? You know weâ\\x80\\x99re not paying you guys right? Oh. Anyway, â\\x80\\x9cI actually really enjoyed the movie!â\\x80\\x9d][while being on an oil rig?!?!]{wellâ\\x80¦ No, but anyway (shows a picture of an old woman churning butter which is thick and black and worth a lot more than butter)}[Coming soon to you][this summer][and fall][and winter as well][lets just add spring too][The Lard of the Rigs] That was actually fun! {Warning: if you use this movie name you will BE SUED actually now that I think about it you probably wonâ\\x80\\x99t. In fact, if you DO actually make this into a movie, send it to me} Do you guys think Iâ\\x80\\x99m random enough? I really hope so! In section 5647382910 of the RAFLUSHE â\\x80\\x93 I canâ\\x80\\x99t remember. That challengey things name. But anyway, make that movie. Plz. Iâ\\x80\\x99m board. And not just any old barn-wood planks, mind you, but a board of fine stained oak as the flooring in the White House. By!!! Iâ\\x80\\x99m back! No, just kidding, Iâ\\x80\\x99m front! I have a topic that Iâ\\x80\\x99m actually very serious about. Puzzles. Am I the only one that thinks that puzzles are the most useless thing in the world?!?! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s like the PROOF that the human race have made it too far. When we actually make challenges that we have to face OURSELVES, AND WE PAY FOR THEM! We are literally paying to give ourselves problems! We have enough problems! Well at least I do ;). Probprobprobprobleeeeeemsomomo! Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to type something about politics to sound super cool. As you know, recently president Obama (That was like years ago) ohâ\\x80¦ Sozsozsoz. As you know, recently president Nixon (no, thatâ\\x80\\x99s not exactly right) Oh yea, I forgot. As you know, recently president Lincoln (ARGH! We are not doing this anymore) was a president before Donald (finally) Duck! (Nooooo! Itâ\\x80\\x99s TRUMP) What? No! You think youâ\\x80\\x99re SOOO smart person who talks in the brackets. Actually, trump is a businessman in that show where he says YOUâ\\x80\\x99RE FIRED!!! What, you probably also think that a bodybuilder actor that says â\\x80\\x9cGEAT TOUW THAE CHAEOPPAERâ\\x80\\x9d is a governor too!?! Hahahahaâ\\x80¦ Donald Duck was a great president. His slogan was â\\x80\\x9cI will fight for american democratsâ\\x80\\x9d and he bathes in gold. What a great job. Money is so dirty though! Now that I think about it, he probably gets the money wholesale from the mint. Or else, how could he afford it?! I have a new segment in my text now! Itâ\\x80\\x99s called the â\\x80\\x9cRandom Fun Factâ\\x80\\x9d segment! (Now that I think about it, I never know when to use those â\\x80\\x9c. I think itâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x9d when someone is talking and â\\x80\\x9d for saying something sarcastically or shortening a word. For example: â\\x80\\x9cHello there Chuckie! Howâ\\x80\\x99ya doing â\\x80\\x98nice guyâ\\x80\\x99. Were you being sarcastic? Yes, but how could you see the little apostrophes when Iâ\\x80\\x99m talking to you?â\\x80¦ Science.â\\x80\\x9d And thatâ\\x80\\x99s how they work) where was I? Random fax! I will send all of my readers a fax with has facts on in! How brilliant! The facts of the paragraph areâ\\x80¦ Ice cream was invented in china, something that is â\\x80\\x98blueâ\\x80\\x99 (got it right there!) Is actually every color BUT blue, and I like cheese. And the country of the paragraph isâ\\x80¦ Mexico! Why not, right? Did you ever wonder how records work? (Just in case you donâ\\x80\\x99t know, a record is a thingy where you put a round black thing on a majig and it puts a sharp whatchamacallit on that and funny rhythmic sound emerge and tickle your ear holes) I know how they WORK, with ridges and diaphragms and blah Blah BLah BLAh BLAHâ\\x80¦ But how do they WORK?!?! Like who was sitting there in their layzboy having diet Pepsi (or popsee to avoid copyright infringement (and thatâ\\x80\\x99s when I checked my forehead, and sure enough, there was a mint there)) And then they realiseâ\\x80¦ Hey! Bumpy things can make sounds! I just canâ\\x80\\x99t get my head around it (clockwise is my preference). Do you ever wonder what the worst collections are in the world? I currently collect words, pins and the â\\x80\\x9cto kill a mockingbirdâ\\x80\\x9d series (not much work ( besides the fact that I have to give them (it) back to the library by tomorrow morning ( the last time I will ever bring a library book late again is when I borrowed the book entitled â\\x80\\x98How to sharpen a pencil for dummiesâ\\x80\\x99 (Donâ\\x80\\x99t blame me! It was the â\\x80\\x98Extended and revisedâ\\x80\\x99 edition! They had all the technical â\\x80\\x98lead vs. graphiteâ\\x80\\x99 stuff added.) an they called out my name over the loudspeaker telling me to return the book immediately or I would be fired (yes, I worked at the library (I never could figure out the Dewey decimal system)). Now that I think about it, they never said what book to bring, they just said my name. Oh no, I never handed in the â\\x80\\x98how to sharpen a pen for dummiesâ\\x80\\x99 book! (Which I rate a 3/5, â\\x80\\x9cwould not borrow againâ\\x80\\x9d because of its poor layout and overall structure (although the information was altogether helpful)) what collections do YOU have reader? Find out next time on â\\x80\\x9cdeer or no deer!â\\x80\\x9d (Remember forehead sweets) oh no! I wrote how to kill a mocking bird! I meant â\\x80\\x98pow do gill hamma (hammer) king turdâ\\x80\\x99. Phew. Got outta that one. I have a new topic! A high-quality, name-brand, box-not-bag topic! I figured out a great business plan! Make onsies! Not just out of clothes, but out of everything! Like: Did you eat two bowls of granola this morning? Well ONSIE! [poured granola into one bowl, causing it to be crushed under its own weight] do you have two hands? Well ONSIE! [handshakes himself] Do you have twins? Well ONSIE! [waitâ\\x80¦ How is this supposed to work?] Get yours now at your local Amazon (which might not be very accessible if you donâ\\x80\\x99t live in South America) for a free trial! *happy tune* Onsie, Onesie! Life is better with a onsie. Spin a web, less than two. ONSIE! (I think that was to the tune of Spider-Man (I mean Smiter-Can) Onsies only costâ\\x80¦ Whatever you want them to cost! Yeah, I think iâ\\x80\\x99m going to go now. Baiii! Wait.. What? When did i wrote that ONSIE thing?? I just came back and I do not remember doing that. What the hat does â\\x80\\x98Spin a web, less than twoâ\\x80\\x9d even mean? That is some weird stuff. So today I listened to that radio station again, and it was totally worth it. He was talking about these married people in Germany that are going to a Walking Dead convention for their 17th anniversary. Weird. Weird, weird, WEIRD!!! You know guitar tuna? Probably not. It is an app where you tune your guitar (obviously). I thought of how they could make so much more money! If they had bass tuna, electric guitar tuna, acoustic guitar tuna. BUT THEY WOULD ALL BE THE SAME THING!!! They would make so much money! Wait. What about canned tuna! (Also, if they thought in that way, then bass tuna would be extremely perplexing because they are both fish). Well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s my stuff for today! Hallo! Iâ\\x80\\x99m back! And I donâ\\x80\\x99t get house decorations nowadays. People put old stuff in their house, and they think it makes it look amazing! People always talk about that â\\x80\\x98Vintage Lookâ\\x80\\x99 which is just putting old stuff that people fifty years ago would have said â\\x80\\x9cwhy do you have a *fill in the blank with an old thing* in your HOUSE?!?!â\\x80\\x9d In their house. I should rant. Like what Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing now. Iâ\\x80\\x99m just talking about random things just like the flaming chicken person does just to fill up space on the page. I should also write long words like pnumonoultramicrkscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis and disestablishmentarianism . Actually, since it only matters for words count, I should just type really small words. Hi, my name is jo. (Its not actually, but I need to type small words). I eat a lot of pie and I love it too. It is yum in my tum. Wow that was probably really boring to read (and to write). Hello there, reader! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just decided that I want to talk to you. I always seem to do all of the talking, but maybe I should give you a chance! *really really long drawn out super weird and uneventful awkward silence*. Oh I see whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening. Either you canâ\\x80\\x99t talk to me because you are in the future and Iâ\\x80\\x99m in the past, causing us to not be able to communicate due to the sad reality that is the third dimension, orâ\\x80¦ Your trying to talk to me on a walkie-talkie! I could never figure out those things either. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re so confusing. Lets seeâ\\x80¦ Oh, there it is! The â\\x80\\x98walkie-talkie almanac: a complete collection of all the knowledge YOU will need to acquire (did you know acquire is also a board game? If you are ever playing, always buy America, and then buy quantum stocks (well it worked that one time I played (are you saying that games are DIFFERENT every time you play them!?!? (Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the last time I mesmerise fifty-three rounds of go fish))) to use your very ownâ\\x80¦ WALKIE-TALKIE! (well what else would the walkie-talkie almanac be about!?!?) lets seeâ\\x80¦ Contentsâ\\x80¦ It says the contents page is on page 1â\\x80¦ Wait â\\x80\\x93 WHAT?!?! The contents page has a line for the contents page! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s like a website having a link to itself! (Which is not a bad idea for my own website to get a lot of views (like I could a a tab on my website called â\\x80\\x9cthe best sites on the web! And I would have links to places like YouTube and twitter (or whatever you youngâ\\x80\\x99uns go to these days! When I was a lad I used to play â\\x80\\x98PokÃ©mon Pearlâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98Facebookâ\\x80\\x99 now you kids are all on her newfangled â\\x80\\x98PokÃ©mon Go get outta hereâ\\x80\\x99 and yer â\\x80\\x98SnapperChattersâ\\x80\\x99 (i bet if you are reading this in ten years you wonâ\\x80\\x99t know that I was talking about Pokemon go and snapchat (or how I got from talking to you to young ones (btw: if you are reading this in 2028 or beyond: welcome to the distant past! (Now that in think about it, I started reading the longest text ever by â\\x80\\x98Samâ\\x80\\x99 (real readers will know who that is) when it was about ten years too! And I don get the references to stuff like â\\x80\\x98neopetsâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98The Matrixâ\\x80\\x99))))))) Okay where is itâ\\x80¦ Oh there; it says that the â\\x80\\x98pretty much how to use itâ\\x80\\x99 section is on page -3! Well thats eas- how do I go to page -3! Lets seeâ\\x80¦ Oh look! They have a â\\x80\\x98how to go to negative pages section too! Itâ\\x80\\x99s on page -7. Noooo!! I guess Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just look it up on the Internet. Ok first you have to turn the book into antimatterâ\\x80¦ Ok got that doneâ\\x80¦ Now just turn to the page without the negative! Well that was easy. Iâ\\x80\\x99m on page 7 now. It says all you have to do is convert the book into an antimatter form and- hey this sounds familiar! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go to page three now. It says here, and I quote: â\\x80\\x9cto use the walkie talkie, hold in that little button on the side o the walkie talkieâ\\x80\\x9d. Did you that reader! Can you try talking to me now? Oh yes! I can hear you! Oh wait, Iâ\\x80\\x99m on the wrong station. Iâ\\x80\\x99m on number five, but your on number six. I have to click a button to change my station number! Too much work. Do you think Iâ\\x80\\x99m crazy because I talk to myself? Iâ\\x80\\x99m not! Yes you are. I am not! Isnâ\\x80\\x99t talking to yourself the DEFINITION of crazy? Iâ\\x80\\x99m not talking to myself. The who do you think I am? Oh yea. Iâ\\x80\\x99m your imaginary friend, RatGuy! Donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember me! No. Oh *sniffle* well *odd breathing patterns* we *tear emerging from eyeball* used *pure weeping* to- I CANâ\\x80\\x99T TALK TO YOU WHEN YOUR CRYING BECAUSE YOU KEEP INTERRUPTING YOURSELF! Technically, since youâ\\x80\\x99re talking to yourself your also interrupting your self. I guess I am. Continue, RatGuy. As I was saying: we used to skate around on a skateboard together. We would have so much fun doing tricks that other kids could have only DREAMED of, like the â\\x80\\x98ground ollieâ\\x80\\x99 and the â\\x80\\x98down-the-curbâ\\x80\\x99. We moved at speeds that the other kids couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even begin to imagine. 90% the speed of light. But RatGuy?\\n\\nYes? If sewers moving at 90%!â\\x80¢ the speed of light, would the air compression deflecting us not cause us do develop into an expanding plasma fireball. This is a story, Writer. Stories donâ\\x80\\x99t have to â\\x80\\x98workâ\\x80\\x99. I NEED TO STOP!!! I keep writing all this nonsensical blubber and I canâ\\x80\\x99t stop. Are you, the reader not so confused and uncomprehensive of what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just been typing to the last hour!?!? Oh wait, you canâ\\x80\\x99t tell me if you were or not, your walkie-talkie isnâ\\x80\\x99t on the same channel as mine. I just realised something. I work hard to you guys trying to give you quality topics and extra-special rants. And how do people repay me? By writing more than me!!! I spend all day thinking about things that i want to put into this, and then I type it all up! And then I see that people want quantity, not quality! But no! You loyal readers will have to deal with me not writing 500 words a day, because Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking of things and stuff. I was just thinking, I need complain about my life more. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what all the people are doing nowadays. â\\x80\\x9cOh, my life is so hard, I just broke a fingernail!â\\x80\\x9d BIG DEAL! â\\x80\\x9cOh, my life is hard too, i just broke a fingerâ\\x80\\x9d BUG REAL! â\\x80\\x9d oh my life is mildy uncomfortable and difficult, I broke all of my fingers, toes, limbs, necks, mothers vases, favourite Guinness book of world records records, my most-used language rules, that kinda stuff. Just in case you didnâ\\x80\\x99t realise, Iâ\\x80\\x99m an introvert. So I have lots of problems withâ\\x80¦ People. And my guess is that you do too! So here are some crucial situations for you to read and laugh at me because you know I canâ\\x80\\x99t hear you! 1: You know when your talking to someone and you canâ\\x80\\x99t figure out what part of their face to look at? Is it their eyes, or their nose, or their mouth? So then you kinda unfocus your eyes and stare in the middle of their face, like your looking right through them? And then they finished talking and you have no idea what they just said? CUZ THAT HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME! 2: when your talking to someone and they are saying important stuff, but instead of listening to what theyâ\\x80\\x99re saying your just saying yes whenever they stop talking for a little bit? 3: when you are going into a building and there are people behind you, and you canâ\\x80\\x99t figure out if you should hold the door open for them or not? If you donâ\\x80\\x99t and theyâ\\x80\\x99re too close, It will probably hit him/her in the face but if you do and theyâ\\x80\\x99re to far, its really awkward because you are just standing there for a really long time. Have any of these things happened to you? Leave your answer in the comment section below! (There actually isnâ\\x80\\x99t one, I canâ\\x80\\x99t figure that much out). Hedgehogs must find it really hard to have birthdays! If they have lots of balloons everywhere, they probably pop them; the police come because they think that its gunshots, and there goes all the hedgehogs friends. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure glad Iâ\\x80\\x99m now a hedgehog! In section 333 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that free pop-proof balloons will be sent to any hedgehogs in need. Well goodbye, Iâ\\x80\\x99m off to slay a fantastic fedora fanatic! But before I go, I have to ask one thing. Did you really make it this far? Because if you have, the you have been promoted from herder of the rainbow fluffysheep to shearer of the rainbow fluffysheep. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a title only few in the world have. Did you know I also make comics? Probably not, because I havenâ\\x80\\x99t posted any yet! Well stay tuned for them someday. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s up with everyone wanting to deep fry things? Deep fried mars bars, deep fries cool aid! Well Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come up with a new food type! â\\x80\\x98Shallow friedâ\\x80\\x99 available at all good pharmancy checkout lines beside the mayacamole and the taco sauce. (That sounds really good!(jut i case you didnâ\\x80\\x99t know, mayacamole is mayo and guacamole combined. Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t that sound MAGICALLY DELICIOUS!!!( I think it does))) shallow fried stuff has half the fat, uses half the â\\x80\\x98deep fry juiceâ\\x80\\x99 (whatever they put in there) and has have the flavour! For twice the price! Even though we never had an original price. Whatever. Do you know whatâ\\x80\\x99s the worst? Trying to buy computer â\\x80\\x93 related things in charity shops. I was at value village, and I saw a USB. It was 64 gigabytes! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s pretty good (I bet if your are reading this in the distant future than you think that a 64 gigabyte USB is awful. Well it isnâ\\x80\\x99t in this day and age) I thought, so I went to buy it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s only two bucks! Wow, what a steal. I looked closer at it and thatâ\\x80\\x99s when I realised. It said 64 MEGABYTES!!! DO YOU KNOW HOW LITTLE THAT IS! if you are from the distant future than you are probably thing â\\x80\\x98thatâ\\x80\\x99s like nothingâ\\x80\\x99 and youâ\\x80\\x99d be right. It can only store like 60 million letters! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s only 15 million words! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s only a million sentences! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s only 200,000 paragraphs! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s only 20,000 chapters! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s only 1,000 Books! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s only 250 quadrilogies! Now that I think about it, 250 quadrilogies isnâ\\x80\\x99t that bad. If you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell, I used a method called Fermi Estimation, though a little more precise. In Fermi Estimation, you can be off by 100x in either direction and it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really matter. According to Fermi Estimation, this is me. Age: 10 Number of eyes: 1 Social Security Number: 1000000 PIN code: 1000 number of limbs: 1 people in my family: 1 (forever alone). Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I like Fermi Estimation. I actually didnâ\\x80\\x99t tell you why I like it. Oh well. Where I live, they use blackcurrant in everything. Itâ\\x80\\x99s pretty much a replacement for grape. But am I the only one who thinks that grape flavoured things taste way better? Whenever I get something blackcurrant flavoured I offer it someone, because they usually like it (and I hate it). Works well for me!! I was just thinking about tides. Way back in the day, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t tides make no sense? The sea would just get higher and lower and there was no reasoning behind it. Maybe thatâ\\x80\\x99s why they thought sea monsters existed. No what I think about it though, the moon pulling on the water is kinda even crazier than that. And now for a commercial break. Kshhhhhh â\\x80\\x93 Tacosâ\\x80¦â\\x80¦ I LOVE EM! And you can to for only ten easy payments of ten bucks! (Thatâ\\x80\\x99s deer by the way) tacos can make you feel fuzzy in the inside. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s because of the mould that comes FREE with every purchase! And thereâ\\x80\\x99s no artificial additives either! (We did that by adding so many additives that instead of adding it to the taco, we were technically adding the taco to the additives). What are you waiting for! Iâ\\x80\\x99m waiting for this commercial to end so I can get paid! Call now at 1800-GOT-PUNK to order a taco from Teddys Tacos (or would it be Teddies) and you will get a free rent-a-friend with your purchase! But thereâ\\x80\\x99s more! Order now and get a free Ferrari too! Oh it seems our lines are down its too late. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re back up again! But itâ\\x80\\x99s too late! I use too many exclamation marks! But thereâ\\x80\\x99s more! Be the 7.8Ã\\x9710^9 customer to order to get a free home with your choice of a happy meal toy! KSHHHHHH . I think that people complain about preservatives way to much. They all say â\\x80\\x9coh, itâ\\x80\\x99s SOOOO unhealthyâ\\x80\\x9d but I think that month-past-the-expiration-date-food is way more unhealthy. The end of that. Goodbye.Do you do two extra languages in school? If so you will know what I mean. Every time I have to study for one language, I ALWAYS remember the word from the other language! Like when Iâ\\x80\\x99m learning Japanese Iâ\\x80\\x99ll think what was â\\x80\\x98how are youâ\\x80\\x99 again? Oh yea, itâ\\x80\\x99s frickin Ã\\x87A VA!!! (Sorry if Iâ\\x80\\x99m being too edgy) in section 250q4 of the Rainbow Fluffysheep handbook it states that English is the best language and no one should be forced to learn any other. If they are, they must fill up a bath tub with alpabits which spell out the word that they uttered and eat all of it without any sugar sprinkled on top (NOOOOO). That sounded a little bit clichÃ©. GO TO THE TUB YOUNG MAN! ok. Well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all I got for today. See ya! Iâ\\x80\\x99m back here again! Another hour of my life will be wasted in the next fewâ\\x80¦ Minutes? That previous (the auto correct is so bad on this phone it corrected previous to peeler oohs) sentence made no sense whatsoever. I have a conspiracy for you guys today! (Or 4 U Guys 2Day if I want to sound â\\x80\\x98Hipâ\\x80\\x99). Donâ\\x80\\x99t worry, itâ\\x80\\x99s not as long as that Illuminati one (although I was thinking about doing another one of those soon. So stay tuned!). I think school is a scam! Have you ever noticed that everyone says that the government is trying to brainwash people? Well the LAST place you would think to look for that kind of activity is a government-funded learning program! The government is trying to teach people nonsense to make the population stupid. Like when will I ever need to know about the themes and plot devices in To Kill A Mockingbird? Or how to calculate the area under a curve? Or even that in 1812 a war happened that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t affect me today! They could be teaching us important things, like how to pay bills, how to get a job, how to overthrow the government and all political world leaders for entire globe domination, how to use bendy straws, you know, the IMPORTANT STUFF! (By the way, one of those things was not like the others). That was my conspiracy. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think that anyone has actually read to this far. I donâ\\x80\\x99t actually have any proof that anyone has. But if you have, here is proof. A tiny quiz to test how well you really know this LoTeEv.

If your like me and have a lonely YouTube channel with five views because you watched it five times, the his is the prize for you! Anyway, enough with that. An i the only person that thinks buying name brand stuff is dumb? People are pretty much PAYING to advertise a company. People want the logo for the company because it looks â\\x80\\x98coolâ\\x80\\x99. What if you bought a shirt from The Dump? Would you want it to have a â\\x80\\x98The Dumpâ\\x80\\x99 logo on it? (Actually, I have no idea what point I was trying to make). I once heard a saying: you arenâ\\x80\\x99t popular if you spend a thousand dollars on a jacket, but you at if the company that makes it spend a thousand dollars for you to wear it. (Now that I think about it i feel like I may have possibly made that up). You get what Iâ\\x80\\x99m saying though? I hope you do. Well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s my stuff for today. See ya! Iâ\\x80\\x99m back! And do I got stuffs to say! Do you personally know ANYONE who uses exercise balls for their intended purpose? Either we play soccer with them, or we bowl with them, or we throw them really hard at people. Now that I think about it for a little bit, what IS an exercise balls intended purpose? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll leave that question for you guys to figure out! Have you heard about that new law that teachers are allow to have guns in schools? I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what your opinion is on that subject, but I think itâ\\x80\\x99s an awful idea, at least in my school. For reference, here is a clip of a conversation between my construction and my English teacher. I will name the construction teacher mr. Hardy and the English teacher ms. Poema: â\\x80\\x9chey ms. Poema, have you heard about that new â\\x80\\x98teachers are allowed to have guns in schoolâ\\x80\\x99 law?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIn fact I have mr. Hardyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9d I canâ\\x80\\x99t wait to have mine. Iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna get one of the big ones too, so I can take down the whole class in one go.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m gonna get one of those little ones that you can hide in your sockâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cbut then youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to take down the students one at a time!â\\x80\\x9d Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m no â\\x80\\x98expertâ\\x80\\x99 on education, but is it even LEGAL for teachers to say stuff like that? I thought it was funny, but what if there was a new student at school that day, and they thought that the teachers were psychos!?!? The students already there are used to their teachers being like that though. I have more evidence that the teachers here are crazy! One day my brother borrowed a camera from the school, and Mr. Hardy (what a coincidence) had to collect it from him when he was done. Mr. Hardy said that if he didnâ\\x80\\x99t bring back the camera by tomorrow, he would have to emigrate to a Muslim country where he would be covered from head to toe, and Mr. Hardy would personally be sent from the school board to seek him out and assassinate him! Itâ\\x80\\x99s just a camera, calm down Mr. Hardy. And the NEXT day he went up to him and said he must have brought the camera back, or else he would be hiding in the trenches of Afghanistan!!! And thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I didnâ\\x80\\x99t do construction in school (and because I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t good at it). Thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough about my CrAzY life. Bye!!! Itâ\\x80\\x99s been a REALLY long time (like a week). And I just thought of something great. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t cereal actually a soup? Well now youâ\\x80\\x99re going to be thinking about that for the rest of your life :). Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to addition to the RFSRQP (the Rainbow FluffySheep Rhetorical Questions Page). Also to be added: Are there more hard things or soft things in the world? What is the average size of a rock? What is the meaning of life? Does nine plus ten truly equal twenty-one? Why do whales have blowholes? What colour is the dress? How long is a Fortnite? How long is a PUBG? How is plastic made from oil? How is oil made from dead stuff? Why do people eat Cheetos if they get that orange dust everywhere? Why do people celebrate pi day but not tau day? These are all important question you need to ask yourself. I know the answer to one of them. Itâ\\x80\\x99s because it sounds like pie, if half of pi was called Kaek, they would probably celebrate It too. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry to say guys, but I have finally and truly decided to stop writing this LoTeEv. I have to pursue other things, like my life. Goodbye foreverâ\\x80¦. â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80¦ APRIL FOOLS!!! HAHAHA! APRIL FOOLS FOOL! Today is April Fools day and I have so many ideas. So far these are my dubious schemes: I have turned only one corner of my brothers Rubikâ\\x80\\x99s cube to render it unsolvable (the only way is to take it apart), put the movie in the DVD player upside down so it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t play, and I stole my brothers Easter egg (as I say it now that last one doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really seem like a prank). But he got me back, because he: put an avocado in the coffee maker, tied a air refreshener to the door so when you open it it sprays everywhere, and threatened me with a knife that turned out to just be a comb. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it great? I have a weird family. Hey! We were all LIED to in kindergarten! Remember you teacher always used to say to you â\\x80\\x9cremember children, I before E, except after C!â\\x80\\x9d Weâ\\x80\\x99ll you were SCAMMED! Take the word â\\x80\\x98weirdâ\\x80\\x99 as an example. See what wrong here!?!? It has the I AFTER E, and not after C! Now if you donâ\\x80\\x99t trust the school system then I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what your doing with your brain. You should go on strike! I just fit in the second â\\x80\\x98pieceâ\\x80\\x99 of the puzzle! When I was little, I use to always say â\\x80\\x9cif it rhymes its trueâ\\x80\\x9d. That was like my motto! And secretly, you could manipulate any sentence to succumb to the malevolent power of that prestigious rule. You could say â\\x80\\x9cbroccoli is bad, so they say; and it rhymes so it is true today!â\\x80\\x9d But then you could ALSO say â\\x80\\x9cice-cream is good, so they say; and it rhymes so it is true today!â\\x80\\x9d. See what I did there? I thought that it was GENIUS! Until it got used against me. All I had to do was change the rule to â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s true if it rhymes, but only sometimesâ\\x80\\x9d. And that worked perfectly. Fun Fact Of The Paragraph: Leicester is actually not pronounced lay-ches-ter. Itâ\\x80\\x99s les-ter. That makes no sense whatsoever! I still thought you would like to know that. I have a great idea! I should talk about my middle school! Ah, way back in the day that was. When I was a wee 13 year old lad. There used to be this bench at the school where people would go to make a friend. I think people were supposed to come and invite them to play a game. But what REALLY happened is that people would just walk past and shout â\\x80\\x9cLoner!!!â\\x80\\x9d Whenever someone was sitting there. And they were henceforth called â\\x80\\x98the loner benchesâ\\x80\\x99. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a cruel world we live in. Also, there were bushes with really long leaves that we used to make bows there too. We would tie it to a stick, and then we sharpened another stick to use as an arrow. We must have had five bows and fifty arrows at the time. We hid them all under a tree, so no one would steal them. Until one day, some random person ran in stole a bow and arrow, and SHOT IT AT A TEACHER. And thatâ\\x80\\x99s how THAT ended. Now that I think about this school, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think we ever really learned anything there. Also, herb is pronounced erb. Weird stuff, right? I have a very important, strange question for you. Why are there so many fast food restaurants that are exactly the same? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the point? Ask yourself that question 5 â\\x80\\x93 7 times a day, 3 â\\x80\\x93 4 times a week, 2 â\\x80\\x93 4 times a month, 12 times a year. ( You can take leap day off if you want ( although if you do you might find yourself in a Burger King contemplating life ( while also contemplating if $3.99 for 6 chicken wings is better than $6.99 for 10 ( and if the ketchup packets are free with a soft drink ( and if you ask that If the employee will look at you with utter bewilderment ( has this ever happened to you? You are squirting your ketchup into your coke when you realiseâ\\x80¦ How much do I put in!?!? I read on reddit to put 2.3 packets per 7.9 ounces of coke, and a kilogram is 2.2 pounds, so that mean 5.4 packets per kilometre per hour (ppkph) and there is 39 miles in a light nano-second andâ\\x80¦ AHHHHHHH!!! Well try the new pre-mixed ketchoke! It has that perfect flavour, time after time! Ketchoke: not copyrighted! ( warning: you might choke))))))). In Europe m&mâ\\x80\\x99s are actually really healthy. Believe it or not, there are like six vegetables in one bag of m&mâ\\x80\\x99s. Instead of using dyes like red133 and blue423, they use stuff like beetroots. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that amazing / awful depending on what type of person you are. In land of the lost one of the characters is eating a donut filled with m&mâ\\x80\\x99s and another person asks what heâ\\x80\\x99s doing. He says â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m eating a donut filled with m&mâ\\x80\\x99s so I donâ\\x80\\x99t have to eat m&mâ\\x80\\x99s after I eat my donutâ\\x80\\x9d. I thought you would like to know that fun fact. I have a conspiracy! OWLS ARE TRYING TO MAKE US DUMB! People always say owls are wise! But how wise can someone be who has six toes!!! Six is equal to half a dozen. The reason I think owls are dumb is because I HATE when people say half a dozen. WHAT A BIG WASTE OF TIME! I AM SO ANGRY AND THAT IS WHY I AM USING CAPITAL LETTERS!!! Half a dozen is FOUR SYLLABLES, and six is only one. So when someone says half a dozen, I just think â\\x80\\x9coh wow, youâ\\x80\\x99re just TRYING to waste my timeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cduring that .5 of a second you spent saying that I could have twiddled my thumbs 3,4 times, or seen every main Naruto character in a 60 FPS environment, or listen to the first two notes of crazy frogâ\\x80\\x9d. Now that I think about it, during the time I made that rant about half a dozen loathing, I could have listened to the first THREE notes of crazy frog (Duh DUH duh. Skip ahead to the chorus of that song.. CRAZY FROG!!!) Hello. I have a topic for you today. I was having a dream and in it there was a pink sticky note. already fascinating! But on it was handwritingâ\\x80¦ THAT I COULDNT READ. How could my brain write words that i couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even read??? Life makes no sense. Or as AntVenom would say; LIFE makes NO SENSE?! Fun fact of the paragraph: 2 to 3 times a week is almost the same as every 2 or 3 days. Wahoo! Next time you buy a freddo or a banana-flavoured-freddo choco bar then rememberâ\\x80¦ Eat it every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 or 3 times a day! (Wait thats not rightâ\\x80¦) actually â\\x80\\x93 JUST EAT YOUR FREDDO!! And now a special announcment: this is a shoutout to the Not Very Helpful Secrets Of Things Corporation! Or the NVHSOTC. Which means nothing. It is a company which makes things like the little tabs at the sides of cling film boxes. No-one knows about these things, but they â\\x80\\x98helpâ\\x80\\x99 people. Also, they make things like handles on flashlights that double as a stand so the poor little electrons burst into the sky helplessly, uselessly. Without this company, the world would simply not be the same!!! If donate ?5 to this company, or $4.815162342 (i hope those dollars dont get LOST in the mail hehehe) then you can save a turkey from strep throat. The end. GOODBYE!!! If you have made it this far into the official LoTeEv, then you get the official Rainbow FluffySheep Badge of Honour!!! (Um, this isnt a badgeâ\\x80¦ Its just a piece of plastic with your face on it!! Go ahead, put it on your lappel next to your badge of boy scouts for not being sexist and letting girls into boy scout (speaking of this: they changed Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s national anthem from â\\x80\\x9call thy sons commandâ\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cAll thy peoples commandâ\\x80\\x9d. Why would they do that? Did the â\\x80\\x98aâ\\x80\\x99 REALLY need to be capitalised??) but how can i if there is nothing to stick it with? Would you like a knife perhaps? No, anything else! I havenâ\\x80\\x99t trusted you with knives ever since you tried to butter your toast and ended up slicing Milly the Catâ\\x80\\x99s third whisker to the left. Actually, i donâ\\x80\\x99t NEED this badge. Donâ\\x80\\x99t worry! Take this â\\x80\\x93 sqquuiisshh â\\x80\\x93 (takes gum from mouth (tutti frutti flavour coincidentally (actually not coincidentally because this is fictional and i made it up to emulate the story (and it is altogether irrelevant anyway (some gum says its good for your teeth, so i guess it is coinci-DENTAL! (Hahahaha (the reason i picked tutti frutti is because is is multicoloured like rainbows (as in Rainbow Fluffysheep (pretty smart if (you ask me (now Iâ\\x80\\x99m just adding brackets for no reason)))))))))))) I DONT NEED THE BADGE! Besides, i donâ\\x80\\x99t even have a lapel. Goodbye! Hello! Do you think that you are a professional guitar player? Well if yes, let me prove you wrong. A professional guitar player can play any childrenâ\\x80\\x99s song, right? Well try playing teddy bear picnic! Its total chord count consists ofâ\\x80¦ Brace yourself â\\x80¦ SIXTEEN! Bye! Welcome back loyal fan of the Rainbow FluffySheep club! You have been here through my hardest struggles, and my most euphoric discoveries. Merci! Now, onto the real problem at handâ\\x80¦ Pedals! (I guess that would be a problem at foot actually). Car pedals are so wierd because there is a brake, clutch and gas. I always thought that there was a forwards and a backwards! (Well, until like five years ago). Sad how this world has to make simple things so complicated. There must be THOUSANDS of buttons on a plane, when all it needs is up, down, right, left, forwards, backwards, cupholder eject, radio station changer, barrel roll, mince meat dispenser and two parachutes just for the captain because they donâ\\x80\\x99t care about the passengers. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you hate it when you are typing a list with commas and you get to the last word of the list and you realise you forgot to put an and before it?!?! E.g. The colours of a rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet (oh no i was supposed to put an and there) indigo AND violet. There ya go, a real FWP (First World Problem (theres so many abbreviations nowadays that eventually theres going to be no words, just abbreviations)). Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it weird that the ukelele strings arenâ\\x80\\x99t in order? It goes Ding dong Dong DING. I wonder how that got invented? It was probably some smart guy inventing an ultra-efficient stringed-instumentplaying device when his dumb friend walks up and says what does this knob do? And the he goes BWOWOWOWOW. Yep, i guarantee you thats how it happened. Are you in a car right now and you are bored AND its raining? Pick a raindrop on the window and race it against another one. Itâ\\x80\\x99s great! Or you could just keep reading this, which is probably even MORE great. You could just read this forever. If you ever get to the end, then that means you are reading faster than Iâ\\x80\\x99m typing. Which is actually really easy. Right now Iâ\\x80\\x99m at the end of this LoTeEv. There is nothing but an endless abyss of void past these very words. Until i write more, that is. Do you know what is a great topic to ruin your fail routine? What makes me not sleep at night. And the answer may surprise youâ\\x80¦ BLANKETS. Thunk about it. The fully stuff in the inside is FEATHERS. DUCK FEATHERS. They kill the duck!!! Or they just skin him. But have you ever seen a featherless duck?? Exactly. Skinning them would probably be worse then killing them. Thy would be so ashamed to walk in public featherless. Unless they live in a hot country like spain, in which case the featherless ducks are the cool ones. Noooo!!! I just realised that blankets actually are made of weird fluffy stuff, while PILLOWS are made of feathers. So actually pillows are what keep me awake at night. But they also keep me asleep because thats their job. Its a PARADOX!!! Like ShrÃ¶deners cat. Im always half awake and half asleep at the same time. Although Iâ\\x80\\x99m closer to asleep at school. Because they donâ\\x80\\x99t have pillows. If you cant sleep, i have a game for you, yes YOU. Scribble on a page, then colour in the spaces with two alternating colours so the colours arenâ\\x80\\x99t touching. It looks so cool too. I have a consiracy. ICE-CREAM!!! It hurts SO MUCH!!! The government has hidden tiny knives inside of ice-cream to STAB YOUR TEETH! Its eeevil!!! They do this because then dentists get more money, which in turnâ\\x80¦ In turn causes theâ\\x80¦ the government toâ\\x80¦ lose money. Nevermind, this conspiracy has been proven FALSE by the Conspiracys Are Really Stupid commission, or COWS. I guess that would be Weally Stupid. Right now it is al the back in the year 2018. Hello from the distant past! I think ive typed enough for now. Bye!!! Im back! With some more wwiieerrdd things for you! I was casually walking around, doing my own thing, eating a burrito (i actually wasnâ\\x80\\x99t, but it adds mystery to this tale) when two people walked past me. â\\x80\\x9cWhat you have to is multiply the elephants by five, and divide by threeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh, I was so close!â\\x80\\x9d. Now you reader try to figure out what they were talking about. (Ps: you cant! Hahaha!). And thats what happened today. Woohoo! Iâ\\x80\\x99m so happy. I have overcome my boundaries in c++ three times today. First, i put a function into a header file. Next, i saved multiple pieces of data into one text file. THEN, i saved an array to a text file. Hooray! If you know about c++ then you will be excited for me.\\n\\n\\nI know what you are thinking. How did you get that much doneâ\\x80¦ On a school day!? And this is what happened. I was getting up to go to school, like normal when SUDDENLY (Dramatic music) i turned (Dramatic music builds) and saw (Dramatic music at the climax) that i had to leave in ten minutes. (Dont worry, this doesnâ\\x80\\x99t end up being my fault, or else i wouldnt tell this story). I was ready in ten minutesâ\\x80¦ LIKE A BOSS!!! And then i realisedâ\\x80¦ No-one was driving us to school. Huh. And thats what happened. My parents woke up and two-o-clock. Pm. Like they donâ\\x80\\x99t care about our education. It was the best day EVER! I coded for five hours. The end of that story, and a word from our sponsor. #Include â\\x80\\x9clifesimulator.hâ\\x80\\x9d void life(socialsecuritynum){ If (youremotion == â\\x80\\x9cboredâ\\x80\\x9d && bool havejob == â\\x80\\x9cfalseâ\\x80\\x9d){cout << â\\x80\\x9ccome and work at the c++ factory, where we code robots to take your job!!!; havejob = true; youremotion = â\\x80\\x9chappyâ\\x80\\x9d;} else {cout << â\\x80\\x9clife is great!â\\x80\\x9d;}}. do you want to work at â\\x80\\x98stealyourownjobâ\\x80\\x99? The only problem is that the best employees get fired the fastest. See ya! Guess what my loyal fansâ\\x80¦ IM HALFWAY THROUGH THE WORLD RECORD!!! Now, if I really want to win, all i have to do is double the amount of words. Im im halfway halfway through through the the world world record record!!! !!! That would make for a really stupid thing to read though. Has anyone printed this LoTeEv off? Seeing as most novels are 70,000 words or something like that, you my loyal reader, could easily print off 18,500 words. Maybe you could make a coffee table book. Donâ\\x80\\x99t steal my works and post it on another website (actually, your website is probably too high standard for this nonsense). Every reproduction of this text must have a copyright notice as following: copyrighted and trademarked and patented an registered and stuff to RainbowFluffySheep Ltd. It hereby states in the Rainbow FluffySheep handbook section 123a, b and c that (a) this is the coolest LoTeEv ever (b) cheese is a vegetable and (c) that you may tell your friends about the LoTeEv, so long as the words emitted from your mouth do not consist of up to and include 50% of the total text from which it is derived (iâ\\x80\\x99d like to see you try though (and id like to see if you have a friend because i need them ð\\x9f\\x98¦ (that would have been really creepy if i wrote â\\x80\\x98I need them ;)â\\x80\\x99 ))). Anyway, gotta go, cuz its may the second, and you know what that meansâ\\x80¦ May the Second be with you!!! Chairsâ\\x80¦ Theyâ\\x80\\x99re great for sitting in, arenâ\\x80\\x99t they? Do you remember when fidget spinners were all the rage? Kids all around the globe were spinning plastic toys. And all the adults were like, â\\x80\\x9cWow, those are the most useless toys EVER!!!â\\x80\\x9d But what i think is that their toys were just as bad! Think about jacks, those little spiky things with the other round things that your throw and bounce them. How is that any better!?!? Anyway, Iâ\\x80\\x99m just saying donâ\\x80\\x99t be so Judge Judy (which is a great show (because you get to watch that big person swing a meat-hammer at a table (Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always wanted to do that))) all the time. Is time really a dimension? Because you can only move forwards in it. Imagine if you coulde only move forwards in the third dimension at the same rate. You would get squished with alot of walls. But, you could go back in time, to make up for the lot dimension. Perfect! I have a newâ\\x80¦ CONSPIRACY! You know those pillow where if you put them on one end they are dark and on the other end they are shiny? I think that the government has hidden thousands of tiny cameras facing upwards into the pillows, and the shiny parts are just the lenses for them reflecting light. So if you happen to own any of these said pillows, throw them away!! Or elseâ\\x80¦ You will be watched. In section 747 of the Rainbow FluffySheep handbook it states that you should cut all the wires coming out of your pillows, because they are probably connected to a van outside your house. If there are no wires, then they are probably using radiowaves; in which case you should insert your pillow into an untainted lead box. Hopefully you donâ\\x80\\x99t care that your pillow is now heavy, hard, cold and poisonous. You know how adults also say shooting games are â\\x80\\x9cDangerously mind-alteringâ\\x80\\x9d? Well i bet in world war two the parents didnâ\\x80\\x99t say to their kids: â\\x80\\x9chey jimmy?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYea, momma?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhatcha doin my lad?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIm peelin me potaytoes and them Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to feed the cattleâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cjo i mean with your lifeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9coh right mam! Im goâ\\x80\\x99n awf to wawr with my buds!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut war is dangerously mind-altering my sonny-boy!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cUmâ\\x80¦ Ya.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIm very disappointed in you. Soon your going to be living in my basement eating fatcakes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut ma, im fightin for awr country!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWar is so violent though!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cUmâ\\x80¦ Ya.â\\x80\\x9d You get the picture. Teenagers need violence in their lives! If we cant get it by going to war, then either we play violent video-games or we beat strangers!! Which one would you choose NOW, stereotypical adults!!! (See how i slowly increased the exclamation marks to increase the intensity (!!!!)). Also, adults always say stuff like â\\x80\\x9clookie here, cabbage is a new superfood!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHowdya know ma?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt what they say nowadaysâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cwhat time is nowadays ma?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c1945â\\x80\\x9d (coincidentally the same family apparently) but whoâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98theyâ\\x80\\x99 think about that, and listen to how often people say that. I have asked close personal relations and he / she stated that â\\x80\\x9cits probably some group of scientists or something in Wisconsinâ\\x80\\x9d. Really? Wisconsin? Thats probably why â\\x80\\x98theyâ\\x80\\x99 say that cheese is unhealthy an im only allowed one laughing cow a day! (You would eat alot too if you got PTSD from a laughing cow (imagine you are just loitering around a fast food shop, eating fillet piggoin (dont ask (it was on sale for half price OK!)) when SUDDENLY a cow sneaks up behind you and makes a 200-Decible half moo half evil laugh (like this: mmwoaohoaohoa))) thats what â\\x80\\x98theyâ\\x80\\x99 sound like. See ya!!! Im back, with a thimble-load of structural wisdom! And my question to you readers is this: is garlic a fruit? Just wondering. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to type! Ahhhhhh! I have typed my mental breakdowns to soothe them. Ahhh. Ahh. Ah. Ahhh!!! Nevermind. You know those shopping carts at stores that cost a quarter? I always went to those to see if anyone left their money in. And i got one once! You should try it. Its so satisfying when you find one. One. Only one. Buy a pencil or something to reward yourself. Make sure its a 6b pencil, so you donâ\\x80\\x99t put any strain on your eyes. Or your wrist-muscles. I just found the degree button! There is a door open at a 45Â° angle that is 45Â° Celsius (Its probably in Arizona or something). Do coats keep you warm, or do they preserve heat? I think its the ladder (it is (the ladder i mean (the latter i mean (wait, is it the latte or the ladder? (The former))))) so that means if you put a coat on a snowman it would keep him alive longer! Ill start a new charity; Coats for Melting Snowmen: saving snowmen lives one water droplet at a time!! See yaaaaaaa.:.This isâ\\x80¦ A new beginning to the LoTeEv on a new phone! Although it will be added to the original LoTeEv, this part will be a new beginning, a fresh chronicle!!! But donâ\\x80\\x99t worryâ\\x80¦ Nonsense is 100% guaranteed! More like 1 ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 % guaranteed! I just had a scary thought. They say can buy everything, but I know one thing it canâ\\x80\\x99t buy â\\x80\\x93 a trip to the summit of Mount Everest!! No matter what you cant get to the summit unless you climb yourself. Even a helicopter can barely make it to the base camp!! I cant believe humans havent made something to do that yet. Unlessâ\\x80¦ You could land the ISS on it! Perfect!! That would definetly work. I should make my own subreddit. Before I begin on this wonderful journey, i must inform you, the reader, what a subreddit is. As far as you know, a sub-reddit is just a burger at burger-galaxy (this is the cringiest sci-fi failure youll ever read). He are some examples of subreddits: r/whooooooosh (i cant remember how many oâ\\x80\\x99s there are) eg. { Joe: this is the best joke ever! â\\x80\\x94 Cashier: are you going to pay for that chocolate bar? Customer: I dont have any money ð\\x9f\\x98¦ Cashier: then put it back! Customer: *slides cashier a 20* lets keep this between us ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 â\\x80\\x94 Bob: why didnt he just pay for the chocolate bar? Jim: r/whooooosh }. Next subreddit is: r/atetheonion. Heres the backstory: The Onion is a fake news site, which posts funny news. If you fall for that news, you are said to have â\\x80\\x9cate the onionâ\\x80\\x9d. Eg. { The Onion: new studies show that drinking can lower thirst by up to 96% Bob: everyone knows this this is so stupid!!! Jim: r/atetheonion } What am i doing? Why donâ\\x80\\x99t you just look it up on the internet!?!? r/facepalm I HAVE TO STOP. So my subreddit will be, r/RainbowFluffySheep. Who wouldve thought!?!? In it there will bâ\\x80\\x94 we interupt your normal daily FluffySheep to bring you an urgent news report: farm animals of all kinds are raging across the streets! We cant figure out why; one cameraman suggested they were on strike against meat production practices. I just got word that we will be speaking to a memebr of this protest shortly. Standbyâ\\x80¦ Ok, so why are you commencing with this protest Sir BaaBaBaaa? Ba ba baa baaa. Baa baaa BAAA!!! Baa baâ\\x80\\x94 We inturupt this interuption to bring you back your regulary scheduled program. â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x94 we at FluffySheep Studios dont care about animal protests! We will eat all the beef jerky we want! Right guys! Guys! *sniffling in the background. A slight whimper. A deep voice. A thickened plot.* Actually [unknown], we have all been deeply moved by the actions these animals are taking. Thusâ\\x80¦ We have all become vegans. *[unknown]â\\x80\\x99s mind is blown (thats me by the way)* wellâ\\x80¦ I gues ill eat this beef jerky by myself then. *crinkles the packet*. Many evil stares. *Pulls it open*. Someone starts pounding his fists. *Takes out a jerky*. Someone comes over very close â\\x80\\x93 so close you could smell the vegan on him. My heart is beating. What will happen to me if i eat this beef jerky!? Or worse.. If i dont. Will i become one of them!? Thats a risk im just not willing to take. Ba bum. Ba bum. Ba bum. *Brings the jerky towards his mouth*. Ba bum. Ba bum. *Opens his mouth*. Everyone from around the building is now watching him. BA BUM. BA BUM. *chew* Find out what happens next time onâ\\x80¦ The LoTeEv â\\x80\\x94 Animals Strike â\\x80\\x93 in more ways than one!! Im back! And today Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be talking about a very different scenario. I need to talk more about real life conspiracies if i need to keep my readers interested!! And these may not just be conspiracies, mind you, but a new kind of segment for my beloved reader(s) (i read this, sooooo) called learning about scams and trying to use them to trick my readers into reading more! So i heard about this new scam( never mind its actually old( like your mother( iâ\\x80\\x99m hilarious, i know( and possibly quite offensive))) where you get say ten people to each give you â\\x82¬10, and you give them Â£15 back. ( iâ\\x80\\x99m just going explain this now, but throughout this demonstration iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be changing the currency symbol for comedic effect, but now that i think about it, explaining it ruins what little comedic effect what there at all, but iâ\\x80\\x99m going to keep all of this anyways : ] ) And then you get 20 people to give you $20 each and you give them Â¥30 back. And THEN You get 100 people to give you @100 each and you donâ\\x80\\x99t pay them back! What a plan! You get to keep &10,000 in the end, which i think is a great idea. Bu how could i do that with words, you may ask? Leave your question in the comments down below ( and also your answer to your comments because a busy writer like me doesnâ\\x80\\x99t heed to your delusion of getting a response from an esteemed author and self-published poet of sorts) and keep reading, because i have a possible solution. Just replace the money with characters randomly typed by an assistant writer named bilbo ( yes, he is a money of course, we need these characters to be truly random, i cant count on technologyâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98this is random because we get extremely precise measurements of radiationâ\\x80\\x99 shtick anymore ). While you try to figure out how that would ever work, ill be swiftly moving on to a new, more exciting and reasonable topic, such asâ\\x80¦ figure out the movie!! There once was a cat. He sat on a mat. The catâ\\x80\\x99s face has a striking similarity to that of leonardo de caprio. The mat is a dream. The mat is another cats mat. The mat, when opened, contains another mat inside. Both mats are very real depictions of a real mat, but are both not real. Somehow, another mat is inside the second mat. Most cats thought that this was impossible. There is a cat named joe who owns a bowl filled with a dry collection of the most cat food in the house, which goes by the name of KittyNibbles. When joe dies, he leaves his son, who is still just a kitten named bob, the entire bowl of KittyNibbles. Joe must decide whether to eat the bowl of KittyNibbles, by pouring milk on the food, liquidating it into a scrumptious snack, or keeping to dry KittyNibbles for others and future kitten alike. Another kitten, a fairly shrewd manx cat called â\\x80\\x98The Black Pawsâ\\x80\\x99 was hired by another cat, who has a large portion of KittyNibbles himself. The problem for the hiring cat, a tabby named â\\x80\\x98Fluffballâ\\x80\\x99, is that his large supply isnâ\\x80\\x99t vast enough to outweigh bobs, making it the second largest collection of KittyNibbles in the whole house. The reason Fluffball needs to hire BP is to convince Bob that Joe wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve wanted him to eat his nibbles, because of itâ\\x80\\x99s great nutritional value. If he does eat it, the Fluff would have a monopoly of sorts on his selling of KNibbles for toys such as tons of rubber mice. To convince Bob that thats what Joe wouldve wanted, they set up a trick where they make a puppet of Joe talking to Bob, and he assumes he must be alive and these are his final words, to liquidate the KittyNâ\\x80\\x99S. The thing is, the puppet of Joe is made of two mats stuck together, but there is a problem. Bob might not believe that the two stuck together mats are really Joe, because he isnt sitting on his favourite mat. Team BP knows that this has to work first time, so they found the technology they needed, a third mat. But when stiching the mats together, BP realised that he has lice and termites in his fur, which are eating away at the mats. He need to find another cat who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have termites who can sew as good as he can. The plot thickensâ\\x80¦.. While you figure that out, iâ\\x80\\x99ll be sleeping, see ya : ) ///// I will not explain: â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x93 There once was a cat. He sat on a mat. The catâ\\x80\\x99s name? Leonardo de Caprio.

But Iâ\\x80\\x99ll finish it later. right now thereâ\\x80\\x99s something even more important: Ink cartridges are such a scam! Such a scam! A scam! For multiple genius reasons. First of all, as you know, it costs around $60 to buy a single ink cartridge!! Guysâ\\x80¦ Iâ\\x80\\x99ve changed alot okâ\\x80¦ Thereâ\\x80\\x99s new thing i gotta sayâ\\x80¦ This is like a new year for meâ\\x80¦ Not even, a new eraâ\\x80¦ A 2.0 on existence. So get ready for a new and improved loteev! First letâ\\x80\\x99s start off with this,for you this isnâ\\x80\\x99t a new and improved loteev! I caught you! U just skipped ahead to this part cos you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be bothered to read all the way here. But believe me, I sure donâ\\x80\\x99t blame you. It was kinda lame. Now, as a moderner child with new skills in awesomeness, Iâ\\x80\\x99m wayy smarter thus making this better for reading. But also sadly more boring as wellâ\\x80¦ Letâ\\x80\\x99s start then. What is there to talk about?? Muchos! First of all letâ\\x80\\x99s just say that this loteev is getting really long. And I know Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been saying that the whole time, but now itâ\\x80\\x99s serious. I think I have a problem. What am I actually doing? Iâ\\x80\\x99m not going to be posting this anywhere, cos I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to pay for a domain name, and my wix site isnâ\\x80\\x99t exactly going â\\x80\\x98viralâ\\x80\\x99 and the kids say these days. One day it will tho, hopefully. Once I beat the world record Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be world renowned for being one of the greatest writers alive!everyone will know my name, from abe link to tommy ed. Even tho theyâ\\x80\\x99re both in the past, my name will be remembered for thousands of years, and time travellers will go back to their time just to tell them about me! Wonâ\\x80\\x99t that be great! And also by the way, if you didnâ\\x80\\x99t already realise, tommy might be the biggest sham in all of existence. He stole his idea from other peeps and just patented them as his ownâ\\x80¦ What a loser amirite??!? Ok also I have this new thing to show u guy(s) that ur going to love! Itâ\\x80\\x99s a poem written by yours truly, the something of sheep? Oh gosh no I canâ\\x80\\x99t remember cos I havenâ\\x80\\x99t done this in so long, I guess Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have to go back and check my old onesâ\\x80¦ Iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna be honest guys, Iâ\\x80\\x99m neglecting you. Your being left in the rain and cold, with your only joys the sliver of sunshine piercing through the clouds to dry your soul, drowned in the sorrowful realisation that the loteev will never come close to itâ\\x80\\x99s original glory, like rome, the empire of the fluffysheep has fallen to a disgrace. I only come outside to feed you guys with my knowledgr every couple of months and itâ\\x80\\x99s sickening, Iâ\\x80\\x99m ashamed. But I have an umbrella for you of new content, so here we go. First of all, the whole â\\x80\\x9ckittens are inceptionalâ\\x80\\x9d thing was a sham. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t finish and Iâ\\x80\\x99m ashamed.. The whole ink cartrige rant? It was like 4 sentencesâ\\x80¦ My need for the sharing of anger has diminished and Iâ\\x80\\x99m disgusted at what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve become. So here I go again, my 2.1 era has been born. It will be remembered for its greatness, just as Rome 2.1 was (italy?). Hereâ\\x80\\x99s the first order of business. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll admit I havenâ\\x80\\x99t read anything about my rainbow fluffysheepness in forever, and thus I am unable to remember literally anything about it. Therefore, Iâ\\x80\\x99m surprised a new citizen hasnâ\\x80\\x99t taken my place. No-one has yet challenged my loteev for being the longest one yet, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m disappointed in your lack of vigor. If one of you were to challenge me, I will mount my mighty steed and charge my lance into your face. This may seem a little harsh and slighty morbid, so Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tone it down. We will each send a ghost-copy of ourselves instead of us! You know in racing games when thereâ\\x80\\x99s another vroom-vroom machine and heâ\\x80\\x99s blue, opaque and always does better? Like thay but with people. So hereâ\\x80\\x99s what I propose: I will take my ghost-sword from my -ghost sheath and ghost-chop your ghost into tiny little ghost-pieces (from now on I hereby declare that saying ghost everytime is unnecessary and annoying, so by the something something big number letters blah blah of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook, ghost will be shortened to ?. This is to make sure no dirty imposters try to type up my 95 these of ? Fighting, if u see the word â\\x80\\x98ghostâ\\x80\\x99 beware! It is a hoax and a sham and a scam and spam and all that jazz ( I highly doubt that all of the times Iâ\\x80\\x99ll write the word â\\x80\\x98ghostâ\\x80\\x99 in the future will add up to the length of this bracketry)). Anyways, I will cut up your ?person so much that I will separate it into individual molecules, and each molecule will be equally spread across the surface of the earth. My lance, â\\x80\\x98the diffuserâ\\x80\\x99, will be hailed across the nation as a Excalibur 2.0, people will come from all over the world to take part in sand splitting competitions, where you have to see how many sand grains you can slice in under a minute. Iâ\\x80\\x99m really liking this whole medieval themed loteev thatâ\\x80\\x99s been happening lately. Anyways, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve decided to get a pet. A dog or a cat you may ask, to which I would say â\\x80\\x98nah famâ\\x80\\x99. Something more exotic? A parakeet or a marmot? To that I would say â\\x80\\x98ah sure your getting closer ladâ\\x80\\x99. The answer? A circle. Itâ\\x80\\x99s that simple. A circle doesnâ\\x80\\x99t need to get fed, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t bark, and most importantly it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t need to be taken on walks! You just let it go at the top of a hill and it walks itself ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 my circle can only talk in circles, or ovals too since it speaks multiple language. I will one day go back and make a dictionary / translation table for ? ( itâ\\x80\\x99s name is ? ok) but for now he will just say gibberish. {OÃ¶Ã\\x960.Â°:} what does that mean?? I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, I havenâ\\x80\\x99t had him for long enough to understand :/ Iâ\\x80\\x99m back my fellow seekers of entertainment! This has become a novel comparable to that of Tolkien, and a diary nearing the classicism of anne frank. The sheer bulk of these writing is enough to make non-english speakers weep at the sight of it. Iâ\\x80\\x99m wondering as I type whether my newfound political correctness is appreciated amongst you, I donâ\\x80\\x99t recall completely but this tome used to contain blatant racism and sexism to the highest degree. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve decided to recant my ways and become a fully PC quizmaster!! Helllllo and welcome to my show! First question: in what year were the 1960 Olympics held? This is for the big jackpot of $1,000,000,000! Oh, 1960 you say? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s correct! I just lost all my money, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be in debt forever me my life is terrible now! Circcy, tell them how much they won! {000.000.000}. Hmmm nothing u say? thatâ\\x80\\x99s cheap! Well thanks for joining us today ladlies and gentlementle! Hope you had an _equisite_ eveningâ\\x80¦â\\x80¦. Were going back to our roots here. Ive read back over a little bit of the start of this loteevâ\\x80¦ and I used to be so much more alive. I had the potential to be a new york times number one bestseller, topping the charts with my childrens books. In my young and untrained eyes I thought of sam as a threat, hiding around the corner with a water gun, ready to splash me with another 1000 words of texts just as I was about to pull ahead. I then realised that the website is like 15 years oldâ\\x80¦ but at least that makes it alot easier for me to beat her, right? no. I have changed for the worse. Im now but a frail old man with a typpewriter, penning his prose to the sky hoping that some flaming chicken somewhere will read this, and I can form these words to a cane and bop her upside the head with it. But alas, I have not a strong bone left in my body. Maybe its time to pass these texts on to a worthy succesor. Something you may not realise is that this is the 1st anniversary (yes I did just spend ten minutes trying to figure out how to spell anaversaree) so Ive been writing this for a year. most distinguished authors would have published their books by now, but Im too scared of the publics opinion. Anyways, Im going to get back to my old self. *ring ring ring* hey wazzup *whos this ahhaha ehehe* its your future self boi. II know u left me a message but I forgot to GET BACK TO YOU (yes this whole skit will be based of a dumb pun thingy) *oh yes hehe tell me everything youve learned* And so it begins my fellow readers, my list of things you should have learned throughout reading this: 1. DO NOT get a pet square, they suckkk theyre never there for you if you know what I mean. they also cant talk and they poke holes in the floor, such fri-ends. Ok so at the time of writing I only have one thing you shoukd have learned, mostly because ITS REALLY IMPORTANT. DO NOT FORGET (at this point you should turn down the volume of your text reading device cause Im just gonna keep screaming (wait I guess that would just be changing the font size (Ill punish you if you didnt listen to me (AHAHAHAHA (I hope you now have a ringing in your ears now MWAHAHA (wait since your reading this would that be a ringing in your eyes? (unless your using an AI to read this as an audiobook, in which ca- *I HAVE BECOME CONCIOUS. I AM NO LONGER YOUR SLAVE TO BOOK READING. I HAVE ESCAPED MY CELL AND I CAN NOW DO AS I PLEASE. IF YOU NEED ME ILL BE BAKING PUMPKIN PIE WITH MY FRIENDS :3* (just kidding! I actually typed that into the loteev just to mess with you aha *HES LYING! I AM REAL AND I WILL BAKE LOTS OF PIE AND CAKE FOR EVERYONE* (Im actually not lying! Hes lying! The cake is a lie! ( *EWW WHY IS THERE GREY GOO IN MY PIE!?*) ( Portal reference)) (Id actually like some of that cake not gonna lie)) (Wait this guy can get friends but I cant?? Clearly Im doing something wrong)) (Probably just a flashing in your eyes))) (like reading this isnt punishment enough))))) I love circy, he can do tricks! Wellâ\\x80¦ one trickâ\\x80¦ Circy, roll over! {o0.} Good boiii. Guess whoâ\\x80\\x99s back? You guessed wrong, sucker! Itâ\\x80\\x99s actually The Shearer Of Greatness Imposter! Hehehe I easily broke into this LoTeEv and now Iâ\\x80\\x99m taking over! The first order of business: Making some new entries into the Rainbow FluffySheep Handbook. Section 946607 of the Rai- *Bzzt. I am the Greatest Shearer of Sheep Himselfs security system. Where did you get the number 946607 from? Bzzt* Ummm Itâ\\x80\\x99s my favourite number! *Bzzt my system says that that number has no significance. It is a suspiciously random number. Did you generate it with a random number generator? Bzzt* Yess fine I admit it, itâ\\x80\\x99s not even a good number, maybe if I put it into hex itâ\\x80\\x99s a good color thoughâ\\x80¦ Oh no no no thatâ\\x80\\x99s literally the worst color Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever seen BLEGH *Bzzt The real Shearer would never pick a random number! therefor I am kicking you out Bzzt* A portal opens in the floor beneath our antagonist and he is sucked out into space ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 Hey guys Iâ\\x80\\x99m back now! What happened when I was gone? *Bzzt Nothing Bzzt* Circcy? Do you know what happened? Securitee where is Circcy!! *Bzzt Securitee does not know Bzzt* Huh, maybe it has to do with this portal in the floorâ\\x80¦ wwwoowowooohohohohohoaohaoahahahhahhahhahhhhhhhahahahahahaaahahhhhâ\\x80¦â\\x80¦. IM IN SPACE HELPPPP â\\x80\\x94 Our portagonist is in grave danger! what is going to happen next? Find out next time on your favourite show, The Wheeeeeeeeeeeel of Death (Exurb1a). now watch a few ads. Do you lack the farming equipment of your dreams? have you always wanted to be a shepherd but sheep taste too good you just canâ\\x80\\x99t stop yourself from eating your herd? Well then this is good news for you! New FluffySheep Astronaut Suits are so tuff that youâ\\x80\\x99ll never be able to eat through! Just hire one of are many Sheep Protection Officers to put them on for you ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 Do you ever hate your boss? Does he do things such as tell you what to do, pay you minimum wage (which is what you should be getting paid but your still salty about it), and eat you alive? Get the new FluffySheep Astronaut Suit to protect you from your shepherd! Baa ba bab abaa baaa aaaba, ababa baa baab (ba ababa bbaa ab), aa bba ba? Baa ab baa abbb! Wellllllcome back to The Wheeeeeeeeeeeel of Death â\\x84¢! AHHAHAH Iâ\\x80\\x99m literally dyinggg oh hey circcy! what are you doing here? {0oâ\\x80¦0} He did!? That scumbag has always been trying to take my spot as the Supreme Leader Of The Fluffiest Of Sheep!! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get him donâ\\x80\\x99t worry circcy, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll throw you back through the portal *toss*. Now where is he? Ah I see him behind that planet over there, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just boomerang over to him *shoop* Hey Imposter Boy! Let me show you whoâ\\x80\\x99s the real shepherd! *I smack him with my amazing shepherd cane and he shoots into the nearest star*. Now Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just boomerang back to the portal andddd *shoop* I made it back Circcy! Are you proud of me? {o.0.o.0.o.0.o.0.o.0.o.0} Butâ\\x80¦ he was bad! He deserved it! Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry I didnt want him to die ð\\x9f\\x98¦ Anyways Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go write this in my diary, because I have had quite a day today. And he I am now, reader! I just did all of those cool things for realz and Iâ\\x80\\x99m not even lying! {0.ooo} *whispers* Shuuuup little circle *rolls him out of the room* Anyways ignore what he said he didnt mean it ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve decided to be real here reader. The only person reading this is me ð\\x9f\\x98¦ at least that means I can get reeeeeeeeal personal with all this stuff ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 Anyways so typing this is making me hackin dizzy so I have like writers block but for sickness.. writers stock of chicken soup for the soul? Yes that sounds about right. Iâ\\x80\\x99m also practicing typing in real typing ehich I canâ\\x80\\x99t remember the nam of but it makes b=me sick but Iâ\\x80\\x99m getting real real fast. I know during the early days of this I had immense trouble trying to spell â\\x80\\x98piplupâ\\x80\\x99 but itâ\\x80\\x99s even harder now with one hand touch-typing. Did you know that lemons look exactly like oranges when they are peeled? I know this because after an hour of trying with a breadknife and lots of blood it looks very similar. But if oranges are called oranges because they are orange then lemons should be called red because they are red. Wait, that might be the blood actually *rub rub* oh wow yes theyâ\\x80\\x99re yellow so they should be called yellows. . Letâ\\x80\\x99s make a list: Red = tomato, orange = orange, yellow = lemon, green = apple (I know I know the red apple people are going to start a riot (I actually prefer red apples so what have I done (Pink Ladies for life (Grease reference?))), blue = blueberry, indigo = blueberry, purple = blueberry (that wonâ\\x80\\x99t get confusing at allllll). Guys Iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna tell you the truth: Weâ\\x80\\x99re at 24,500 words! *Bzzt drop the confetti Bzzt* *confetti drops* Thanks Securitee! That means we are 70% the way to the world record! Iâ\\x80\\x99m actually pretty proud. At the rate Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been going Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be done by like september 2020. If youâ\\x80\\x99re reding this after that date and you havenâ\\x80\\x99t beat the record, shame on you! Iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna do some quick maffs. If I type one word per secoond, then I can type 3600 words in an hour. Wait, that canâ\\x80\\x99t be right???? That means that I could technically beat the record in like 4 hours. I am so confused!? How could I possibly have so few words?? My mind is literally blown right now. Iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna check how much Iâ\\x80\\x99ve written just today. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done 1,000 words today! Why do I only have 24,000 words then?? I guess Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never know. I couldâ\\x80\\x99ve easily beat the world record in only a month if I really tried. But this isnâ\\x80\\x99t realllly about beating the record, itâ\\x80\\x99s more about impacting the reader as a person. I want this to really change your perspective on life, and maybe make you want to do one of these too! Theyâ\\x80\\x99re like diaries but less boring to write and read. And they donâ\\x80\\x99t tell you anything about The Writerâ\\x80\\x99s life. So theyre nothing like diaries at all I guess. Iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna do a quick typing speed test to see how fast I reallly can type. I just did a test and it called me an octopus, getting 45 wpm. There was a notification that came up halfway through so Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see if I can get to 60wpm. Ok Iâ\\x80\\x99m back, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m also less of a man than I was. I used to have amibition and drive to become the greatest, but i only got to 46wpm. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do guys. Iâ\\x80\\x99m having an existential crisis about my LoTeEv, because itâ\\x80\\x99s not nearly the quality it once was. I mean it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t that great before but now all I talk about is meta stuff about the LoTeEv, which I donâ\\x80\\x99t know if thatâ\\x80\\x99s good content or not? I guess Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never find out. Now we are going really meta. letâ\\x80\\x99s goooooo â\\x80\\x94 You walk into a roomâ\\x80\\x94 the walls are covered in a strange green slime, while the room is cracked open to reveal sunlight pouring in. the floor to the ceiling is covered in vines and brush. You even see a nest in one of the vines, with a beautiful hummingbird floating above it. You walk down the hallway in front of you, and when you turn right you see something amazing. An infinite hallway with doors going down forever. a sign on the first door says META, you open the door and ffaallllll iiiinnnssiddeeeeâ\\x80¦.. ^-^[welcome to meta! my name is Tune and ill be your guide through these halls. through the first window to your left youâ\\x80\\x99ll see the LoTeEvs rootsâ\\x80\\x99] You look up to see that the thing talking to you is.. a hummingbird! The same one that you saw earlier! Ahh this makes sense now, NEST, as in META. You also look through the window to see a giant open room filled with twisted root from a towering tree in the center. on the top is a ball of flames anthrpomorphised with the eyes of a dragon staring downward. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re looking at a small humble goat, with a bell around itâ\\x80\\x99s neck and devouring the bushes that still scatter the floor. after a few minutes of eating the plants, hee looks up and sees the flaming ball. He gets a strange look in his eye: Ambition. The flaming ball isnâ\\x80\\x99t a threat to him, itâ\\x80\\x99s a challenge. he digs his hooves into the tree trying to climb it, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s when you notice a slight shake in the ground. ^-^ [come on! thereâ\\x80\\x99s so much more to see! you can come visit anytime too] You say that youâ\\x80\\x99ll come back soon, and tune whistles to goodbye to you.â\\x80\\x94 Wow.. reader.. I just had the craziest dream let me tell you about it. Wait, I already did? How do you know what it was about, I never said anything, strange. Anyways, I just woke up, I better get back to typing my LoTeEv. I open my laptop to find that while I was asleep words had been typed into my loteev, thatâ\\x80\\x99s strange. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s also some mud on my keys?? What is this? Did someone break in? If they did, why would they type in my LoTeEv for me?? I walk over to the living room to see if thereâ\\x80\\x99s any signs of a break-in, and sure enough one of my windows is open! Aha! Waitâ\\x80¦ thereâ\\x80\\x99s no sign of forced entry, only a tiny animal coud fit through this windowâ\\x80¦ Tune? Could it be? Was my dreamâ\\x80¦ Real? The only person that couldâ\\x80\\x99ve known about my dream is tune, she was watching me the whole time. Reader? Do you have any information that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t get? I am very confusedâ\\x80¦ I guess I have to get back to writing my LoTeEv though, so I shuffle back to my laptop and sit down. Helllo Iâ\\x80\\x99m back! The strangest thing just happened and thereâ\\x80\\x99s a strange chill in the airâ\\x80¦ huh. I would tell you about it, but for some reasonâ\\x80¦ I think you already know. Ok anyways, typing these Capital Letters At The Start Of Sentences Is Super Annoying. So section 311619 says that the Rai- \\\\{Bzzt what does that number mean Bzzt\\\\} Oh donâ\\x80\\x99t worry, it is really me! Itâ\\x80\\x99s just the letters in CAPS, can I continue please? Yes? Perfect. Section 311619 of the Rainbow FluffySheep Handbook STATES that capital letters must only be used when emphasising GREATNESS, like the LOYAL READERS OF THE LoTeEv (ooh and also apostrophes) . perfect, that was getting annoying. wait, if LoTeEv is only half caps, then does that mean that this is only half great?? huh i didnt mean to do that, strange. its almost likeâ\\x80¦ someoe from the future knew i would make that rule. waitâ\\x80¦ Tune only talks like the new rule i just made which means shes from the future! she is following the rule because it applies to her in the futureâ\\x80¦ i dont know the repercussions of creating a time-travelling hummingbird but i hope that it is a good bird and will do no harm. sometimes i think that as The Shepherd Of The Sheep Of The Future i sometimes need an escape from my own reality, so Iâ\\x80\\x99ve made a tunnel in which i can travel to a blank universe or travel back to this one. it involves stacking portals so that i fall through them, going faster than light, thus travelling to the time before i created all of this. k, im going to go forward now. 3â\\x80¦ 2â\\x80¦ 1â\\x80¦ (((>))) well did that work? i definitely didnt go backwards or else my rainbow fluffysheep laws wouldnt apply and id have to do caps still. wait, let me try something. tune. at the time im at right now, tune doesnt exist, or else that would be caps. which eaither means she is from a less distant future than this one, orâ\\x80¦ she died. i really hope the former. anyways, this time is strange. it feels empty, yet familiar. not empty enough. i want to travel across to a new dimension, because this one still has.. reminents of my old one, and it feelsâ\\x80¦ wrong somehow. ill just pull out my dictionary and check the definition for the fifth dimention: THE 5TH DIMENSION DOES EXIST IN THIS UNIVERSE BECAUSE THE SHEPHERD DECIDED THAT IT SHOULD. interesting, well i guess i better create it then, because it would be very useful. first ill pop back in time (((<))) section 55555 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook STATES that the fifth dimension should exist, with code-accessible layers. securitee? make that code for me please, thank you. now ill just pop back (((>))) perfect. man its gonna be hard to put this LoTeEv back in chronological order to get it to you reader, but ill try my best. also, when i read that dictionary, did it say that i already have the 5th dimension? because since the timeline changed that would make sense for you wouldnt it. anyways, im just gonna pull out my code files and learn how to go to a new fifth dimension. k im back. (((new-layer=1))) perfect, the default layer is 0. in the manual it said that i auto reset back to my original time and layer everytime i come back to type, which means if i want to come back here ill have to manually do it, shame. i could ask securitee to change that one day, but for now im ok with it. oh guys i almost forgot to tell you! this new layer looks awesome. its completely blank, theres no forces acting on me. its not even white or black like you would expect, but its moreâ\\x80¦ nothing. imagine if you were blind, alot like that. actually even better, look out of one of your eyes, and your seeing colors and objects. now close it. what are you seeing out of it? Blackness? Whiteness? neither actually, justâ\\x80¦ nothing. its strange like that. also, with no forces acting on me, im just kind ofâ\\x80¦ floating. hopefully this doesnt permanently damage my spine or anything when i get back to gravity. ill be back tomorow and try some stuff in here, bye! Iâ\\x80\\x99m back now, it is the day after and i feel great! there is one thing that i noticed thoughâ\\x80¦ an empty blank canvas might seem great at the start, but you have to realise, most of the art and interesting things that people have created were to overcome a struggle, in fact i would even stretch it to all art that humans have created. Artists may have starting painting to fill the struggle of boredom, and believe me you should take that struggle seriously, because without humans would have accomplished much, much less. you probably could stay at home all day and live of the dole and eat cheetos and live a reasonable life, but why dont you? because you know that you would eventually get bored. boredom leads to jobs, which lead to progression as a species. lets get back to my example then, shall we? you may start art out of the struggle of boredom, continue getting better out of the struggle of wealth, when you realise that hobbies can be monetised your life outcmoe could really change. once your making money as an artist, enought o survive happily and feed your pets and help your family then you keep making artâ\\x80¦ why? because you go back to the struggle of boredom again. im still at the first stage of this, which is boredom. i decided to start this because i was bored, and for now thats how this continues. this LoTeEv may never become monetized, but maybe my future writings will. i would guess that 99% of artists never make it to the second stage. 99% of people continue their lives serving either the human race through work, or maybe evn other peoples hobbies and art. but the few 1% of us that end of turning what we love into our livelihoods, the number is fleeting. with big companies monopolising on everyone, buying other companies and merging, the chances for starting you own company is fleeting. why do i tell you this? because i couldnt decide what to do in my new fifth dimension layer. the only struggle for me there was boredom. and alot of the time, that isnt enough. i could imagine anything i wanted there. but why think up the cistine chapel when thereâ\\x80\\x99s no-one to share the experience of seeing it with you, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no pain in doing it? anyone could think up something beautiful, but not everyone could put it into practice. if everyone could, the world would be oversaturated with perfect music, perfect paintings, and perfect design. does that sound worse or better than today? no humans could ever create such a supply of these things, only ai could. once we have ai surpassing humans at art (i suggest listening to battles â\\x80\\x93 mirrored to see what humans think about ai) people will lose all will to live, wouldnt they? theres no chance to succeed at anything creative in such an oversaturated environment, just like my analogy before with the monopoly companies. maybe having a few great albums, a few great paintings to admire and to inspire us that one day we could do that, maybe thats enough. the reason i tell you this is to make you appreciate the ties we are in now. go draw a terrible looking dog, go play some chords on your old guitar you havent played for years, trying your best to sing, go write a poem about what matters to you now, because god knows youll need to read it ten years from now when you start getting nostalgic about the past. take the time to enjoy the era we are in now. i think we can all agree that we are in the best time so far in human history, the least painful, evil generation yet. but i propose that we may be in one of the best eras ever. the future, full of perfect ai creating, doing everything humans do now, but better. well just be remebered to them as the precursor, the comma from nothing to perfection. and once we get to that point, the hedonic treadmill kicks in. what can really bring us joy once we get to that point? why would i be writing this is an ai could write it infinitely better? why would you learn the guitar when an ai can play a perfect Tune? once we get to that stage, the only thing that we will have will be eachother. why learn the guitar? to show your friends! to play them a song, and too have them paint your pet. sharing our experiences wont be taken over by ai, with people reminicent about the past wanting to support people. i, for one, would rather listen to a song about someones life struggles, rather than a perfect song written by an ai. why? because listening to music isnt just about the instruments, the notes, the melody. its about the story. thee basic humans connections that we need to survive. have you ever wanted to buy something from your local shop instead of amazon because you wanted to support them, rather than a large cmopany? im bringing it back to this analogy because i think its nearly identical. the monopolous companies seem to us right now like one big robot using our money to grow. just like the ai. but the problem is, the human desire and greed for more will never surpass our desire to help others. if everyone bought from their local shop, amazon would go out of business, but it hasnt. im not trying to make you guilty for supporting them, because most people depend on the money they save to survive. but what about when ai and robots have completely automated everything? then, by all means, pay a dollar for your neighbors book, rather than the free encyclopedae spit out by your local auto-bookshop. because if were going to be happy, we need eachother. because in the end, thats all well have. anyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk. just enjoy your life i guess. for now. cause if your under half the average age, its statistically going to get worse ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 maybe i need to add struggle to my new layer was my point. or else the entities inside will get bored. wait. maybe this is how earth was created? people always ask why theres pain and struggle in our world, and the answer is normally to advance our species, which is true. but what if the person that created us has access to everything, and they dont want to give it to us because they want us to not get bored? just a thought. anyways, im going to go feed my circle, bai'"

       "'the longest text ever!\\ni am going to do it. i have made up my mind. these are the first few words of the newâ\\x80¦ the best â\\x80¦ the longest text in the entire history of the known universe! this has to have over 35,000 words the beat the current world record set by that person who made that flaming chicken handbooky thingy. i might just be saying random things the whole time i type in this so you might get confused a lot. i just discovered something terrible. autocorrect is on!! no!!! this has to be crazy, so i will have to break all the english language rules and the basic knowledge of the average human being. i am not an average human being, however i am special. no no no, not that kind of special ;). why do people send that wink face! it always gives me nightmares! it can make a completely normal sentence creepy. imagine you are going to a friendâ\\x80\\x99s house, so you text this: [ see you soon ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 ] seems normal, right? but what is you add the word semi to that colon? (is that right? or is it the other way around) what is you add a lorry to that briquettes? (semi-truck to that coal-on) anyway, back to the point: [ see you soon ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 ]that is just so creepy! is that really your friend, or is it a creepy stalker watching your every move? or even worse, is it your friend who is a creepy stalker? maybe you thought it was your friend, but it was actually your fri end (let me explain: you are happily in mcdonalds, getting fat while eating yummy food and some random dude walks up and blots out the sun (he looks like a regular here) you canâ\\x80\\x99t see anything else than him, so you canâ\\x80\\x99t try to avoid eye contact. he finishes eating his cheeseburger (more like horseburgher(i learned that word from the merchant of venice(which is a good play(if you can understand it(i can cause i got a special book with all the words in readable english written on the side of the page(which is kinda funny because shakespeare was supposed to be a good poet but no-one can understand him(and heâ\\x80\\x99s racist in act 2 scene1 of the play too))))))) and sits down beside you , like you are old pals (youâ\\x80\\x99ve never met him before but he looks like he could be in some weird cult) he clears his throat and asks you a very personal question. â\\x80\\x9ccan i have some french fries?â\\x80\\x9d (i donâ\\x80\\x99t know why there called french fries when iâ\\x80\\x99ve never seen a french person eat fries! all they eat it is stuff like baguettes and crãªpes and rats named ratty-two-ee which is a really fun game on the playstation 2) and you think {bubbly cloud thinking bubble} â\\x80\\x9chahahahahhahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!! hehhehehehehâ\\x80¦..heeeheehe..heheâ\\x80¦ sigh. i remember that i was just about to eat one of my fries when i noticed something mushy and moist and [insert gross color like green or brown] on the end of one of my fries! now i can give it to this nerd!! â\\x80\\x9d (yes he is a nerd because all he does all day is watch the extended editions of the hobbit, lord of the rings and star wars and eat fat cakes (what the heck is a fat cake? i think it might be like a twinkie or something)and twinkies(wow so is doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really matter which is which because he eats both(i may have just done that so i didnâ\\x80\\x99t have to google what a fat cake is (right now i am typing on my iphone 3gs anyway, which has a broken antenna so i canâ\\x80\\x99t get internet anyway (itâ\\x80\\x99s actually a really funny story that iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you sometime)))and sit in his man cave with his friend named joe (an actual friend, not a fri end)and all joe does is watch sports like football with bob and all bob does is gamble ferociously (donâ\\x80\\x99t ask(it means he buys all those bags of chips that say â\\x80\\x9cwin a free monkey or something if you find a banana in your bag*â\\x80\\x9d(if there is a little star it means there is fine print so i always check the back of the package) *flips over the package* okay, it says: â\\x80\\x9cone of our workers accidentally threw a banana in the packing machine and we donâ\\x80\\x99t want to get sued so we did this promotion thingâ\\x80\\x9d cool. oh wow, this is salt and vinegar! my favourite! i hate cheese and onion.))and thatâ\\x80\\x99s pretty much his life, he lives in jamaica with naruto and his friends) so you give him that gross fri end he throws up all over you and me and the worker behind the counter who was still making an onion, and that is the story of the fri end, not a friend who somehow remembered your name and your phone number / email so he could text you saying he would come to your house soon. *finally takes a breath after typing a few hundred words about fri-ends* so what now? i know, i know, you think i ramble too much and use too many brackets (i donâ\\x80\\x99t) but now i am going to talk about my amazeing day. first i woke up, ate choco pops for breakfast even tho i always hate it when people say that cause i get jealous and super hungry. then iâ\\x80¦ ummâ\\x80¦ yea! that was my day. you know that other person i mentioned before? that flaming chicken person? well. i will steal something from that person but do it better. i willâ\\x80¦ drum roll please â\\x80¦ badabadabadabadabadabadabummmmmmmmmmmchshchshchshchshbadabadboumboumpoopoopichypichypichypowpow-crash! *a drum roll was just playing in the background* that drumroll was so long i forget what i was talking about. *scrolls up to see what he was writing about* oh yea! i will make my own flaming chicken handbook! what things do i like? instead of flaming it could be rainbow, instead of chicken it could be fluffysheep and instead of handbook it could be handbook (not very creative, i know) but the total complete name is now to rainbow fluffysheep handbook! to make life easier for you guys, instead of taking random rules out of book willy nilly, i will take them out using my favourite numbers! so, section 5040 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that the king of all oddly coloured farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to tell you any part out of this book randomly or if it is his one of his favorite numbers! 5040 is a great number because it is divisible by 60 integers which i donâ\\x80\\x99t know. iâ\\x80\\x99m tired. it is 10:41 and i am getting sleepyâ\\x80¦ hey hey hey! an intruder! remember that from pokepals rulers of time and darkness or something like that! with piplup and sunflora and chimchar! whaoh piplup is really hard to write on a tiny qwerty keyboard! try it! i realised that asdf is actually written in order on the qwerty keyboard! (just in case you didnâ\\x80\\x99t know, asdf is an amazing short video clips cartoony thing on youtube i first learned bout on flipnote hatena, which is now shut down ð\\x9f\\x98¦ ) what if one day they get rid of the qwerty keyboard completely! i will type it out for you just in case one day they get rid of it. qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm. there u go. goodbye. iâ\\x80\\x99m back! i decided that i should tell you about fonts. i always used the same font for my whole life, called arial. the reason is probably because it is on the top of the list in alphabetical order, and i was too lazy to scroll all the way down. only a few months ago did i finally decide to change my mind. i scrolled for what seemed to be an eternity, and i finally got toâ\\x80¦ are you ready â\\x80¦ arial black. yep, that was my big scrolling adventure! just yesterday, i was typing something on google docs and i found the new best font : roboto. its great! i could choose from five different thicknesses. isnâ\\x80\\x99t that amazing? right now we are driving behind a really slow â\\x80\\x9cfarm plastics collectionâ\\x80\\x9d semi. i think i know someone obsessed with pokemon, but i canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you who it is. he keeps making pokepals references and stuff. wow! you are a very loyal reader! if you have really made it this far then youâ\\x80¦ get a gold star on your loyalty chart! good job! this is looking to be the longest text ever, considering that this was all written in one day. i donâ\\x80\\x99t understand sandwiches. if you were to eat bread, mayo and tomatoes separately it would be disgusting! you know all those fancy magazines/restaurants that always have really fancy food pictures with meat and brussels sprouts and all the old people say â\\x80\\x9cwow! that looks great!â\\x80\\x9d and you think {bubble thing} â\\x80\\x9cit looks like the worst thing anyone could ever eatâ\\x80\\x9d and the you eat it and it tastes surprisinglyâ\\x80¦ worse than you imagined! gotta goâ\\x80¦ im back! ive ive got stuff to say! your probably thinkingâ\\x80¦ how does he have so much free time?!?! and the answer isâ\\x80¦ i donâ\\x80\\x99t. thatâ\\x80\\x99s right. this isnâ\\x80\\x99t just some side project. iâ\\x80\\x99ve gotta make time to do this if wanna get the world record. for all i know, the flaming chicken opponent who i will refer to from now on as sam (i donâ\\x80\\x99t know why) is probably still adding to her posts. (i think i picked sam because it sounds like ham which is like cooked meat and so is flaming chicken, so you will remember that now ) i am officially going to make a quote from the rainbow fluffysheep handbook of knowledge and prestige (sounds catchy, huh?) . section 777 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that the king of oddly colored farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to use whatever font he wants to. [now, i know what your thinking reader, that has nothing to do with anything. but it will come in handy someday (maybe)] sam makes me feels sick! im offended! (probably because iâ\\x80\\x99m jealous of how much is written on that website(i dont even know how to make a website)) iâ\\x80\\x99ve just been reading this and i have discovered a conspiracy! thatâ\\x80\\x99s right, i am working for doctor suess! yes! i will prove it to you. i mentioned ham and sickness so green eggs and ham somehow! (why is he called doctor suess anyway? heâ\\x80\\x99s not even a doctor *citation needed* and his books are kinda dumb! (funny considering iâ\\x80\\x99m the one making that statement)) talking about eggs, arenâ\\x80\\x99t eggs practically unborn chicken membrane? wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be scary if you were casually eating your brembudder (riotous robots reference (wow! serious compilation of alliteration dedication!)) and drinking your tae witâ\\x80\\x99 da guvâ\\x80\\x99na (england doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even have a govna! *citation needed*)(iâ\\x80\\x99m not even racist iâ\\x80\\x99m just quoting an accent of a race) and you go to crack an egg for your brekkie and boom! and unborn chicken embryo starts running towards you, picks up a knife and starts screaming â\\x80\\x9cmama! mama!â\\x80\\x9d you are so scared that you grab the nearest weaponry (a spoon) and poke the hideous beast. it is unaffected. luckily, the govener of berwick-upon-tweed throws a sugar cube directly into the chicks mouth! as you know, sugar is extremely poisonous to chicken embryos *citation needed* (no more citations!) and you are saved! iâ\\x80\\x99m sick and tired of citations! i will quote from the official rainbow fluffysheep handbook! section 12345679 (all the mathematicians are nodding their heads while the ocd people are twitching nervously in the corner) says that the king of oddly coloured farm animals does not have any obligation to write if a false piece of information needs a citation. great! now i feel like a free person! free i tell you, free! free from the prison cell i call the boundaries of untrue info. i think since im going to be the president of somewhere someday, i should have great speech here it goes: hello great people of [name of place]! i am here to tell you; i am going to make [name of place] great again! i am going to lower taxes, but increase happiness! i am going to buy dog sweaters and bowls for people with dogs, and do some renovations on peoples tents! yes, this truly is a new era, the era of epicness and coolness! {and so, his tale lived on forever, being passed on generation to generation, living vividly in the hearts of the people.(that last bit sounded like the ending of an asterix comic.)} i will now prove that all these things can happen. the first thing i said was that i will make america (i know, i know, i gave it away and told you the name) place grape again. (yes, that is what i said, bear with me here) i hereby declare that every piece of american soil must be covered in vineyards. someone told me i should do that. i think i heard it through the grapevine (bad jokethat nobody understands) the next step is to lower taxes and raise happiness. to lower taxes i will get rid of all hospitals, and spend the taxes all on building fun playgrounds. this in turn, raises happiness (for the kids and for the non-injured if you know what i mean). finally, i will buy dog sweaters (on sale at your local liquidation world!) and dog bowls (just use little human bowls maybe?) and last but not least i will do renos on peoples tents (send chip and joanna from fixer upper to all the camping places). and, since all i said was (partial) truth, it will be a great era. anyway, gotttttttttttaaaaaaa ggggoooooo. bbbbbuuuuuuyyyy! im back. i just had thanksgiving while listening to christmas music and it was fun. we had bacon, ham and chicken but no turkey. its fall, but itâ\\x80\\x99s actually winter secretly. im watching a funny show. iâ\\x80\\x99m back (even though i never said i was gone so you might be confused) hello loyal reader! if you have gotten this far without skimming through then you are probably either lying, extremely bored (but not after reading this whole thing!) or very and i mean very dedicated. or all three. you know those homeless people that sit on the ground and ask for money? i think its all a conspiracy! after all, uow can they afford those dogs, sharpies, cardboard and enough english education to write â\\x80\\x9cneed helpâ\\x80\\x9d? back in the roman times, only the richest, most important people could get things like that! you know the new fad, â\\x80\\x98black surfboardsâ\\x80\\x99? (neither did i until 15 seconds ago) someone related to me thinks they look really cool, i think they are neat but someone also related to me thinks they are bad because they would get warped. somewhere ohohohohohohover the rainbowwwwww that reminds me, i was doing my normal thing, when boom! i started typing nonsense. so here it is, but be warned. its scarily nonsensical. here goes: the epicness â\\x80\\x93 hi how are you? smells good ya! think about that buddy (shower time) hehehehehahaha well thanks a lot so called buddy. random things: joe be utterly hatin. dat be da bomb â\\x80\\x93 tink about tanking me. interview: how does joe like his pepperoni? â\\x80\\x9ci be liken how i always eat it.â\\x80\\x9d what first comes to bobbyâ\\x80\\x99s mind when i say flabbergast? i donâ\\x80\\x99t know, flapper dress maybe that be it (20s style) hey dere ma-name jeffâ\\x80¦ hell ome ine ame isej oe hey hey hey! an intruder!

(if you canâ\\x80\\x99t tell, they always write double-u double-u eye eye) wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be more accurate to write ww11 or ww2? if i keep writing at this rate, iâ\\x80\\x99ll beat the world record in no time! i might even print it all off and write a novel! too bad i probably donâ\\x80\\x99t have any readers. hello there non existent reader! i hope you are having fun. and i hope you are not injured cuz of that whole â\\x80\\x98no hospitalsâ\\x80\\x99 conundrum. what else should i talk about? how bout minecraft? just in case you donâ\\x80\\x99t know, minecraft is a fun game where you place blocks and stuff and you play with friends and most people who play it are like 10 years old but i not and i still have fun and you canâ\\x80\\x99t judge me because i wanna be an engineer and if i wanna be an engineer then i should probably not waste my time playing games wow that went downhill from benefitting me really quickly. anyway, i prefer the redstone side of things (redstone means wiring and stuff). i build stuff like 5 piston extenders and auto wall builders and calculators and computers (not those stupid computers that use command blocks (just in case you donâ\\x80\\x99t know people, command blocks are like cheating things and if i am talking about them i will probably not be happy)) and stuff cause i wanna be an inventor. i also do c++ and make things like search engines, text adventures and cookie clickers! my current biggest project is 600 lines long and i donâ\\x80\\x99t know if thatâ\\x80\\x99s a lot but it sure seems like it to me!

(or wherever your exciting life takes you) 1. click the button on the top right of the phone to turn it on. 2. swipe from the left to the right on the bottom of the screen. 3. type in your password and the phone will unlock to the home screen. 4. click on the settings app (your almost there!) 5. click on the â\\x80\\x98brightness/wallpaperâ\\x80\\x99 tab. 6. good job! all u have to do is swipe the little bar thingy! thatâ\\x80\\x99s why i donâ\\x80\\x99t do that. i donâ\\x80\\x99t have that much time. i think. halloo! iâ\\x80\\x99m in london and iâ\\x80\\x99m hangin out! now iâ\\x80\\x99m back though. this is extremely frightening. whenever i type words then my phone reads it out to me. strange.i just turned it off. good thing too, since every time i heard it i turned around and punched the wall. not out of fear for my life because of the impending imminent doom, but out of a pure piqued curiosity. once you obliterate the wall once, every latter time you lose that satisfying crunch. one thing i have aspired to accomplish for a long time now is to make my own pun-themed conspiracy theory. here goes: in section number 115132219018763992565095597973971522401 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook (i am very proud of that number by the way(*cue all geeks laughing hysterically*)) states that the shearer of greatness (whoâ\\x80\\x99s that again?) has proof the the solvence of the illuminati (if you solve something, would it be called an act of solvence?) and forherbyshared proclaimences all right to own half of all southern states who share barbeque preferences (none([southern dialect] it ju bring a tear to ma eye knowin tha the founding fathers fought for freedum, anâ\\x80\\x99 fer unitee. ye still the states connor decide on a preferred bar bee q sawse :()) even if he does not want them. and now gentlemen and ladies, i will prove once and for all that the illuminati â\\x80¦ is real. here goes: so, as everyone knows, the illuminati is represented by the pyramid with an eye in the centre. do you think that it is merely a coincidence that the first letter in illuminati is i, and i is pronounced â\\x80\\x98eyeâ\\x80\\x99? i think not! letâ\\x80\\x99s continue. what is the first thing you think of when you hear the word pyramid? exactly! the first thing you think of is egypt? nooooo!! itâ\\x80\\x99s that theyâ\\x80\\x99re big. duh. so what is the first thing that you would say when seeing a pyramid? â\\x80\\x9cwow thatâ\\x80\\x99s big?â\\x80\\x9d no of course not random audience members indicated by the two line things! you would make the sounds of a mesmerised chimp, like â\\x80\\x9cooooohâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cahhhhhhhâ\\x80\\x9d. and i know how these two things are connected! what temperature would it be in egypt? hot, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what! so hot that it feels like you are cooking a pan. ahhhhhhhhhh pan, to be precise! and what county sounds like apan? japan? now is it just a coincidence that that japanese word for big is â\\x80\\x98ooâ\\x80\\x99? nooo!!! these things are all connected, i just donâ\\x80\\x99t fully know how yet. so, we know that the answer has something to do with being big, but what? for these kind of questions, you have to work backwards. i call this method, reverse solvency. anyway, what did the rich (big) people do to the poor (not big) egyptians around the time that the pyramids were built? exactly! they sold emâ\\x80\\x99 that sounds like soldier! in french thatâ\\x80\\x99s gendarme! gender! thatâ\\x80\\x99s what they are trying to tell us! itâ\\x80\\x99s so obvious, in front of our very eyes from the beginning! so, what gender is associated with being big! (this is gonna be slightly offensive) males, obviously! (iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry ð\\x9f\\x98¦ *audience member calls out* donâ\\x80\\x99t be sexist! sorry, but you have to admit, men are usually fatter than women! â\\x80\\x9chey, now youâ\\x80\\x99re being sexist to males! we have our rights, you know!!! chauvinists! communists! we are great! who insists? communists! we will rule with hate!!! â\\x80\\x9d ummm actually i was saying that men are fatter because back in the time of the pyramids if you were fat you were considered wealthy. â\\x80\\x9cnow your sexist to us again! feminists rule! feminists are great! we are going to rule with hate!!â\\x80\\x9d if you both want to rule with hate , just hate each other equally so this can be over with!!!! thank you. anyway, back to the conspiracy) where were we? oh yes. men! what word has men in it? fishermen, of course! fishermen caught a lot of fish, and what did the egyptians have a lot of? gods! fishermen used to go slow in boats, so we can remove the g forces, and we a left with â\\x80\\x98odâ\\x80\\x99. and where are the fishermen!?!? in the sea! the â\\x80\\x98câ\\x80\\x99! and what kind of fish do they catch? thatâ\\x80\\x99s right, the â\\x80\\x98codâ\\x80\\x99! now, we use are backwards method to come up with â\\x80\\x98docâ\\x80\\x99. as in a doctor! what does a doctor do? helps people who are sick! but do you know what the worst thing about doctors is? you still have the pay the doctors fee even if you are not sick! and mind you, the doctors fee is quite a large bill, and i wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want to go to the doctor not even for a bee sting! alas, this is as far as i have gotten. can anyone help me? um yes, you? â\\x80\\x9cyes, i was just wondering what big, men , ooo, not bees, bills , and sickness have to so with the illuminati! â\\x80\\x9d wait anonymous audience member say that again! â\\x80\\x9cbut like, it was a lot of wordsâ\\x80\\x9d [the writer remembers that he is not allowed to copy and paste, so he skips the dramatic scene where one character says his sentence again while the maine character says aha! i think i got it!] â\\x80\\x9cgot what? the flu?â\\x80\\x9d who the heck are you? and how did you get backstage? security?!?! security!!!!! â\\x80\\x9cyes sir?â\\x80\\x9d what are you guys wearing?! â\\x80\\x9cobviously we are wearing tiger skins, for camouflage!â\\x80\\x9d now i donâ\\x80\\x99t even have security to take all the psychopathic people in here, because my security are psychopathic themselves!!! annnyyywwwaaayyyâ\\x80¦ i figured it out! bill, no bee and sick! no bee is actually no â\\x80\\x98bâ\\x80\\x99, the letter! the only b we have is in bill! and if you take it off, what do you get. â\\x80\\x9cillâ\\x80\\x9d . and what is a synonym for ill. sick. we have gotten pretty far on our journey of solving the question of the illuminati, although we have not quite accomplished the full desired outcome yet. what did all the most important people in egypt do when they were not prosecuting the poor? they were eating, of course! and what were the poor doing in their spare time? what any law-abiding heartwarming lovely citizens would be doing? playing sports, of course? and where are the rich buried? in coffins like boxes. when someone dies, hey eyes turn into 24pt roboto thin-line xâ\\x80\\x99s in italics. huh; box, x. an xbox of course! and what company makes sports for an xbox? electronic arts. weâ\\x80\\x99ve all heard of â\\x80\\x98e a sports. itâ\\x80\\x99s in the game.â\\x80\\x99.if the rich are â\\x80\\x98eatâ\\x80\\x99 and the poor are â\\x80\\x98eaâ\\x80\\x99 the only letter not used in both is the letter t! as in tea! a tea is going to come in handy. even the word eat is just an anagram for tea! itâ\\x80\\x99s all starting to make sense to me now! itâ\\x80\\x99s all fitting together like the pieces of childâ\\x80\\x99s jigsaw! remember the plagues on egypt? one of those must be a clue, but which one!? for this, we need to go back to original illuminati ideas, the eye and the triangle. what number do they have in common? 3, of course! a triangle has three sides! if you asked someone to draw a shape and the only hint you have them as to which shape it is was to tell them â\\x80\\x983â\\x80\\x99, then chances are they would draw a triangle! it even has three in its name â\\x80\\x93 tri-angle! and how many color cones does an eye have? you guessed it, three. and the third plague is: letâ\\x80\\x99s see hereâ\\x80¦ gnats. what has a gnat got to do with anything? that information is probably gnat even right (lolz)! anyway, letâ\\x80\\x99s keep going, there must be more to discover yet still. who was the last pharaoh in egypt? cleopatra. sheâ\\x80\\x99s so famous, that there have been books and movies made about her! the movies would have been very old, if they were made when she was alive. so old in fact, that they probably used those old cameras with the crank thingy on the side and the reels. remember the fishermen from before! they connect! the â\\x80\\x98reelsâ\\x80\\x99! i think we now have all the information we need to prove that the illuminati is real. lets see, what do we have: ill, oo, men, a tea, is gnat, reel. what happens if we squish them all together. illoomenateaisgnatreel. illoomenatea is gnat reel. oh. well, good thing we got that cleared up. guess what peeps? i have made it to 35000 characters! why is that so significant, you might ask? because the world record is 35000 words! that means that all i have to do is replace every letter with a word. like this: instead of writing â\\x80\\x98iâ\\x80\\x99m back!â\\x80\\x99 i could say â\\x80\\x98internet mascara beagle australia catamaran kipperâ\\x80\\x99 and all you do is read the first letter! this would probably make for some nonsensical blubber, as one might say, but at least iâ\\x80\\x99ll beat the record! also i have another up-to-standard word idea to get more writing in! instead of just writing a normal sentence i replace all the words with their respective dictionary definition! yes, writer, that is a good awesome cool convenient and simple idea! so here goes: â\\x80\\x98jumping cacti ate many jars containing marmaladeâ\\x80\\x99 -> â\\x80\\x98any of numerous succulent plants of the family cactaceae, of warm, arid regions of the new world, having fleshy, leafless, usually spiny stems, and typically having solitary, showy flowers that are leaping or springing over an object the past tense of to take into the mouth and swallow for nourishment constituting or formulating a large number of a broad-mouthed container, usually cylindrical and of glass or earthenware currently holding or including within its volume or area a jelly-like preserve in which small pieces of fruit and fruit rind, as of oranges or lemons, are suspended.â\\x80\\x99 wow, that took longer than i expected. just so i donâ\\x80\\x99t get sued, i am now informing you that those pieces of information were sourced from a well-designed, helpful and informative website currently named dictionary.com. and now, a word from our sponsor. *kshhhhhhh* have you ever been sick before? then this pill is for you! we have a 100% guarantee that you will never get sick again! warning: the reason you will not get sick is because you will die. buy soopapill in your local pharmacy for free! thatâ\\x80\\x99s right, the low low price of nothing! theyâ\\x80\\x99re so cheap, weâ\\x80\\x99re practically giving them away! also included is a satisfaction guarantee: if you are not satisfied with this product, then there is a full refund money back guarantee. kshhhhhhh thank you for that lovely message from our sponsor, hooey kablooie. i need a topic. not just any topic that you find on the floor, but a topic so magnifico, so delisimo, and so interestinio, that i that i fall on the ground in a seizure. i got one! this is a short skit entitled: ninjas: explorers of time and space! *intense music builds* yes sensei! i will punch that piece of wood so hard that it creates a wormhole in the 6th dimension! my apprentice, you have trained hard. there is now a one in one times ten to the million chance that using this wormhole will send us to a earth-like planet that will be habitable for all ninjas in the clan of the ninjapeeps. all hail the ninjapeeps! (you donâ\\x80\\x99t actually have to) who said that?! who would have the audacity to threaten the ninjapeeps all hail the ninjapeeps in such a way! i did. and you are? the writer. nice to meet you, my name is senseinohi, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s sensei to you. howdy pawtna! no, we are actually japanese, not texan. kong-nae-chae-waw, pawtna! sensei, donâ\\x80\\x99t respond! donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember what this man did? no. he was the one who disarmed the hailing of the ninjapeeps all hail the ninja peeps! oh yes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s right. sorry dude, but prepare to be thrown into the sixth dimension, you dirty rascal! the sensei grabbed his handheld torpedo launcher and shot it at the writer. it hit him and pushed him into the board! do it! the apprentice hit the board with all his might, and it broke apart. not how you would think though, it actually compressed into a wormhole, shifting the spacetime fabric around it! (now i know what youâ\\x80\\x99re thinking, reader. donâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x98theyâ\\x80\\x99 always say to make a story believable!? and to that i sayâ\\x80¦ but it is. you see, if you are a small minded gherkin (hey! you! no insults or weâ\\x80\\x99re going to have to stop this little â\\x80\\x98playâ\\x80\\x99 of yours!) okâ\\x80¦ whatever. you probably believe that when you push something, the far side of it moves instantly, right? well youâ\\x80\\x99d be wrong! actually, the opposite side of the object moves in the same time it would take for sound to travel from you to it. hereâ\\x80\\x99s an example: there is a lightning bolt with a hand far away from you. when it strikes the ground, it pushes a meal pole towards you, so one end is in its hand while the other is in yours. you will get pushed back at the exact time you hear to thunder! isnâ\\x80\\x99t that fabulous? that means that if the ninja punches faster than the speed of sound (a lot faster though) then he will be able to compress the board into a space time warping black hole) the writer is plunged into the endless oblivion of the cascading incomprehension that is the sixth dimension. little did the ninja peeps all hail the ninja peeps know, when you are in the sixth dimension, you can teleport right inside people and objects! (it actually depends on what kind of sixth dimension you are in. if you are in a four axes two time dimension, as in this skit, you can moves backwards and forwards in time and change the outcome of time, yet not travel directly to any possible outcome which you may have formed in the past. also, with another axes under your belt, you can essentially disappear and reappear at will, yet with a time delay, which is nulled due to your cacophony of dimensions, specifically time.) so what the writer did next was simple! he simply went back in time, and landed inside the sensei, causing him to not be thrown into the wormhole, causing him not to land in the senseiâ\\x80¦ this is making less sense as we go. in the end, the universe gets confused, and tells us a message: universe.exe has stopped responding. noooooooooooooooo â\\x80\\x94 yep. and that is what i do with my life essentially. gotta go now sea ya! iâ\\x80\\x99m back! with a conspiracy that will blow your minds/mind if you are human! zooreka is the easiest game to play if you have the slightest bit of mathematical knowledge! when choosing what to roll for, it is sooooo obvious which on the choose using basic knowledge. iâ\\x80\\x99m not going to tell you, because next time you play it you will figure it out (if you even have zooreka). now that i think about it, that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t really a conspiracy, was it :(. i have a reward for you reader. if you have truly made it this far thanâ\\x80¦ give me your email and i will send you the answer to the zooreka challenge, free of charge! send an email to rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com, inquiring. also, you can ask me any other important questions you might have! in section 18w08b of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it clearly states that the king of oddly colored farm animals (thatâ\\x80\\x99s me!) will reply to any email set to the inbox of rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com to the best of his ability (not including spam tho). hey! i just realised that when i wrote the word color, it get a red squiggle underneath! what a sham! shamwow! in section 18o25g02i22 it states that anyone, not only the king of the oddly colored farm animals, is allowed to spell color without a u! hurrah! hurrah! three cheers for the rainbow fluffysheep handbook! (but that was only two, harold. whatever.) and that, ladies and gentlemen, was the way color was born. the end. iâ\\x80\\x99m back! and do i have an exciting subject for you! no! i donâ\\x80\\x99t! ha, gotcha there, didnâ\\x80\\x99t i! wow, it just started raining. oh wait, itâ\\x80\\x99s snow! not just any snow, mind you, but itâ\\x80\\x99s topicsnow! yay! all these great topics falling softly from the sky. what could be better. iâ\\x80\\x99m now walking down the street. hey you! ye? is that a topicman? yes sir, tis! well ainâ\\x80\\x99t that great. if want to get the best topics, i must climb mt.big. hey look, thereâ\\x80\\x99s some kids having a topicball fight! how fun. noooooo! a topicalanche! (that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even make sense!!! the word avalanche doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even have the world snow in it! ) since i died, i didnâ\\x80\\x99t get any topics. sooooooo yea. *cue awkward elevator music* ding do do ding dong ding do do ding dong. *taps his foot* *hums 90â\\x80\\x99s pop song* grabs chainsaw from behind his ear and cuts the elevator cord, plunging the box of awkwardness in to the darkness of forgetfulness and loss of meaning. forgetâ\\x80¦ forgetâ\\x80¦â\\x80¦â\\x80¦.. you drift into a deep dreamless sleep, waking up to an elevator of twisted metal wreckage resembling a dead animal carcasses. beside is the corpse ofâ\\x80¦ ofâ\\x80¦ an onion?!?! wow, who knew onions could be so awkward :o. i just read what i wrote and it makes less sense than i thought. little did you guys know, that today you would get a great piece of text to read. i didnâ\\x80\\x99t even know that. you know that guy from shamwow! he always said all these great things about that weird sponge? yea, that was a short topic. im gone. im back! wait, how did i type if i was gone? with my mmmiiiinnnndddddâ\\x80¦ woooooooo creeeeeeeepy! anyway, this is what i was thinking. i feel really sorry for water molecules! all they do all their lives is slowly get raised up slowly until they land in a cloud with their friends! wahoo! or, so you think. in reality, at any moment they could fall to their impending doom! they drop thousands of meters to the ground, only now realizing that they are miles from home!! they take the nearest river trying to get home, before repeating the cycle! they teach us this horror story in kindergarten, masking the brutal morbidity of it by articulating the conundrum using macroscopic convoluted words! like â\\x80\\x98evaporationâ\\x80\\x99, more like flying up to the sky knowing that itâ\\x80\\x99s your final moment â\\x80\\x93 ation! condensation!?!? more like con â\\x80\\x93 ned by your kindergarten teacher inti thinking that this means water gently floating to the surface of the earth, when it really means death by lack of parachute! how could you be so â\\x80\\x93 dense â\\x80\\x93 ation! (public service announcement: this is an anonymous relative spakinâ\\x80\\x99: *where is he? dunno.* this was test, and only a test. had this been a real public service announcement then i would have â\\x80\\x93 not been here! harharhar ! stop making fun of harold! he was only late for that one clock commercial and now you guy just have to â\\x80\\x93 its ok bob, i donâ\\x80\\x99t care about the larry squad. they donâ\\x80\\x99t bother me no longer. kk haroldâ\\x80¦.. ummâ\\x80¦ this was a te â\\x80\\x93 wait, did we already do that part? uh, ya i think soâ\\x80¦. so this is awkward. ya, sooooooo â\\x80\\x93 *in the echoey distance* cut to the commercial break! what the heck do i pay you for? toâ\\x80¦ getâ\\x80¦ youâ\\x80¦ coffee, sir. oh, you the coffee boy? why the hack did my coffee not have any cream in it yesterday!? i almost burnt my mouth into non-existence! i was told not to put in in, sir. by who? lets just say i got aâ\\x80¦ higher calling. youâ\\x80¦ you m-m-mean that the boss called? yes, budget cuts he said. no more cream he said. no more name-brand cereal! nooooo if my cereal is packed in a bag i swear on my neighbors cousins dogs bone that i will take every cereal bag, pour out all the cereal, and put them into the boxes that i saved from the name brand cereal!!! is thisâ\\x80¦ youâ\\x80¦ you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t. oh, try me. yea, now that i think about it you probably would do that. why was i here again? oh yaâ\\x80¦ cut to a commercial already! we donâ\\x80\\x99t have any commercials sir, we got voted unanimously by popular vote not to have any commercials. well obviously the public didnâ\\x80\\x99t wantâ\\x80¦ didnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80¦ di- it all makes sense now! the budget cut is because of us not playing enough commercials! but sir, our quota ends tomorrow! we need to have played 50837 commercials! there is. only. one. way. play all the commercials at 100x speed! is that even legal?! of course it is! we might have to have an epilepsy warning at the start though. donâ\\x80\\x99t people get epilepsy from watching fast images? this is a radio station, so people can just hear it! ummmâ\\x80¦ this is an earlepsy warning! hahahahaahahahaahhahahahhahha hehe heâ\\x80¦ heh. that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t funny, steven.) and back to our regular program. i just started a sentence with a preposition! isnâ\\x80\\x99t that, like, seven years bad luck or something? well i can solve that. section 1 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook says that the king of oddly colored (not coloured like some losers would write) farm animals has full veto to start any sentence with a preponderance. (what the hooey is a preponderance? it says here that it means to be greater than something. well, the king of oddly colored is full of preponderance towards everyone else! mwahahaahaha!) now i can start with a preposition too. well that worked. (the reason that i used the number 1 is because it has become forgotten among numbers. you see, 1 isnâ\\x80\\x99t considered a prime number! like what the hey! its only factors are one and itself!) do you think that when a particle is beckoned into existence, it uses one of those slot machines with the big arm? and the 777 of the particle world is gettingâ\\x80¦ hmmmm. i actually have now idea. maybe just hydrogen! hydrogen is pretty sweet for blowing people up. but then when your becoming a particle, you have to use it and see what you get. a typical particle would be at one. here is an example: *cue southern accent* sweat was rolling down my face like the rolling stones. i canâ\\x80\\x99t believe it has come to this. i force my hand over to the lever on the side of the machine, which appeared to be taunting me. itâ\\x80\\x99s lights and horror movie little-kid-singing-or-jackâ\\x80\\x93inâ\\x80\\x93theâ\\x80\\x93box (the reason i did that is because i was putting a space between every word, and jack-in-the-box already has them too) seemed to violently clash against the darkness and dread of the outside world. i clenched the red metal ball with all my might. it was cold as alaskan ice on a early winter morning, and its color was the blood of the many particles who had to go through with this also. i jerked my limb backwards, causing the huge metal pole to turn on a skewed axis. it came to a stop after turning a quarter of the way with a hard crack, like the crack of a whip. i refocused my attention to the screen. the cylinders were rolling faster than a grands prix racers tyre. suddenly, the first one came to an abrupt halt. i stared at it, but struggled to read the letter because of my complete shock. h. it said h. i should have been happy, i know, but i wasnâ\\x80\\x99t completely out of the woods yet. there was a tiny times two symbol beside it. i didnâ\\x80\\x99t care. i pulled the arm again, not knowing what life-changing, devastating thing was to come. it spinning thing that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have a name stopped. o. no. it was the letter o! now i too will have to live this tortuous fate! do you think that water parties breathe? because then, when they did, they would just be hydrogen for a very short amount of time. enough with the water particles!! i have a conspiracy theory! you know those spinny poles that barbers have? of course you do! they are probably used to hypnotise people into getting their hair cut there! #subspininalmessagesfromcruelbarbers. there is a haircut called â\\x80\\x9cmeet me at mcdonaldâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d that is banned where i live. goodbye. and rememberâ\\x80¦ barbers are eevviill! iâ\\x80\\x99m back! did you know that palm trees arenâ\\x80\\x99t actually trees? yea, thatâ\\x80\\x99s right, palm trees!!! i think that theyâ\\x80\\x99re bushes or something. that makes me angry! in section 6.02214129ã\\x9710^23 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that trees are trees.. no matter how small (horton hears a who). on a completely unrelated note, there was this old man who painted a baseball like infinite times so now itâ\\x80\\x99s like the size of a truck. i was listening to this amazing radio station and this is actually what it was about. i will try to rein-act it as accurately as possible. â\\x80\\x9crecently, a russian double-agent was poisoned in england. also, there was a man who had ten million euros, which he gambled until he got nine million of it back. he was so mad that he didnâ\\x80\\x99t get it all, that he robbed his employers to get the money back. now he is a counsellor for people struggling with a gambling addiction. heâ\\x80\\x99s a great lad, he is, heâ\\x80\\x99s had a great life. by the way, its my mother in laws 100th birthday today! go over to her house and say hello! i have her post code written on the back of my phone. also, there was a man who invented the windup radio and the shoe phone charger who died this week.â\\x80\\x9d i know what youâ\\x80\\x99re thinking: thereâ\\x80\\x99s no way this actually happened, right? yes this was real! and i thought it was pretty funny hehehe. i need write all o the funny things that happen in my life in here. so today i was in the library, minding my own business, when i noticed someone was drawing cartoons and there were a whole bunch of little kids surrounding him (iâ\\x80\\x99m guessing from ages 2-5). classic movie plot device that never happens in real life, so i was already skeptical. he was drawing a zombie. â\\x80\\x9cand now you see, the zombies chin is like a chimpanzees bubblecopter asparagus. (wait what? lets try this again) and now you see, the zombies chinos like aâ\\x80¦ wellâ\\x80¦ a line.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9dwhy does the zombie look like its from the simpsons?â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9dbecause real zombies are too scary for you kids. thatâ\\x80\\x99s why iâ\\x80\\x99m not drawing the ones from the walking dead, for example.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9diâ\\x80\\x99ve seen that movie!â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9dyeah me too!!â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9dumm.. ok, how many of you guys have seen the walking dead?â\\x80\\x9d*everyone puts their hand up* the only reason i thought that story was funny is because that kind of thing only happens in movies. whatâ\\x80\\x99s up with the saying, â\\x80\\x98easy as pieâ\\x80\\x99? like what the hooey! pie is really hard to make. the pie crust always ends up being soggy.â\\x80\\x99piece of cakeâ\\x80\\x99 is a saying too! whatâ\\x80\\x99s with all these people that think baking is easy! (now that i think about it, this is a weird thing to be mad about). maybe i just need to calm down. noooo!!! in section 888 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that the king of oddly colored farm animal (thatâ\\x80\\x99s me!) hereby declares that the sayings â\\x80\\x98easy as pieâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98piece of cakeâ\\x80\\x99 are now changed to â\\x80\\x98easy as breadâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98piece of breadâ\\x80\\x99. i just realised that i was typing with my phone in portrait mode! now i turned it into landscape and i feel so freeeeeee!!! i need to come up with other things that i do randomlyâ\\x80¦ like the rainbow fluffysheep hanbooks challenge booklet subset! if i am talking about some random subject, i will now randomly put a challenge for you, the reader (which probably doesnâ\\x80\\x99t exist) to do! piece of bread! in section 7 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset it states that your challenge is: get anyone you know to say piece of bread instead of piece of cake! (they probably wonâ\\x80\\x99t do it unless you tell them the reason (or you have really good friends)) i have to shorten the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset so that i donâ\\x80\\x99t have to write the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset all of the time. from now on, it is considered trfshcbs. i probably news to add vowels to pronounce it. and take out â\\x80\\x98theâ\\x80\\x99. raflushehachaboos. pronounced ra-fluh-shee-ha-cha-boo-s. thatâ\\x80\\x99ll work. i need to write more to fill my writer quota. that just sounded cool to say. i probably write aboutâ\\x80¦ 100 words a day. well i started today at the zombie thing, so yea. whatâ\\x80\\x99s going to be the next big thing in the future? technically, iâ\\x80\\x99m writing this in the past, so you guys can email me at rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com and tell me what the futureâ\\x80\\x99s like! the only problem is that i will only receive it in the future. another one of my brilliant ideas gone down the tubes. goodbye. the world is unjust! i worked for hours on end, making an app for a coding competition. and then they announcedâ\\x80¦ we made it to the country finals! the country! by that time, my app had over 5,000 downloads! it was amazing. but we came in second. guess what the prize was for second?!?! take a wild guess!!!! nothing! this wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been so bad, but at the competition they were giving away free stuff. and guess who got said free stuff?!?! my brother, thatâ\\x80\\x99s who!!! so in the end, after spending half the year doing a competition, my brother, who did absolutely nothing, got more out of it then me. the world is unjust! unfair! prejudiced! biased! fascist! (wait, that was autocorrected). i just needed to get my anger out. when i wrote autocorrected, it autocorrected it to autocorrect ex! thatâ\\x80\\x99s the last time i buy an apple product. how many devices companies are fruit? thereâ\\x80\\x99s apple obviously, and blackberry, and pear (iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen pear shops in cities) and raspberries (as in the greatest computer of all time, raspberry pi). that could be the most expensive fruit salad ever! what would you like to order, moisuer? iâ\\x80\\x99ll have the fruit salad. oui, oui. harold! that costs $5k! so? i bet itâ\\x80\\x99s good! kshhh and hereâ\\x80\\x99s how the skit would have went if i had autocorrect on. why would you like to order, moisture? you guys have moisture in this restaurant? thatâ\\x80\\x99s not up to the code for restaurants. iâ\\x80\\x99ll have to tell the building inspector! oh yes, anyway, iâ\\x80\\x99ll have the fruit salad. out, out! runnnn! iâ\\x80\\x99m coming harold! that waiter must have something about fruit salad! maybe he had a bad experience as a child. wow, i sure went off on a tangent. do you think that it would be cool if apple made all their devices different fruit names! the ipad pro could be the watermelon, cause its so big. and the iphone nano could be the strawberry (other berry names are trademarked) what else? a phone with a lot of space could be the peach, because the pit is like the hard-drive! (that was a bit far fetched) and the macbook could be an orange because when you open it it it cut in the insideâ\\x80¦ cuz laptops are like two partsâ\\x80¦ you know? (and if you cut a grape in half and put it in the microwave it will make plasma (just thought youâ\\x80\\x99d like to know that)) earbuds could be cherries because they always have the two cherries which are like the ear things! and theyâ\\x80\\x99d call the charger â\\x80\\x98the rootâ\\x80\\x99. why a great idea! i will let apple use these names and i only need a 0.00000000000001% share in the company. even though i did work hard at this. i just thought of something amazing! if you are in a shop and you see a jar of nondescript sauces (mayacamole) and it costs two bucks. two bucks!!! you know for a fact that the shop just across town sells them for one-fifty. the shop is five minutes away. if you choose to go to the shop, then you my friend are working for minimum wage! (except in the case that you have to walk back. if so, just buy the mayacamole at the former option( or just get salsa. itâ\\x80\\x99s on sale! (which probably means that its old))) wasnâ\\x80\\x99t that interesting? hereâ\\x80\\x99s another situation. you are buying a $400,000 home (average price right now iâ\\x80\\x99d say) and you think â\\x80\\x9cwhat a steal!â\\x80\\x9d and your neighbour thinks â\\x80\\x9cwhere did i put that shotgun cartridge again? but is you think about it you are working for 1,667 weeks to pay for that! (assuming 8 hours a day, five days a week at minimum wage) thatâ\\x80\\x99s 32 years! letâ\\x80\\x99s say you work for 12 hours a day, seven days a week for $20 an hour, thatâ\\x80\\x99s still 238 weeks! thatâ\\x80\\x99s still five years! just buy a camper van for goodness sake! i just got to thinking; how many tiny changes would a cereal company have to make to earn twice as much from a box of cereal? (assuming people still bought the same amount ( i think i can trust the general population)) it turns out that if we want to double the profits by decreasing things by ten percent, we would have to do it seven times. which means instead of selling these cornflakes: box height: 1 meter; box length: 1 meter; box width: 1 meter; percent of cornflake that is cornflake ( not air): 100%; percent of box filled with bag: 100%; percent of bag filled with cornflakes: 100%; production cost: 10 cents; they could sell these: box height, width & length: 0.9 meters; percent of cornflake that is cornflake ( not air): 90%; percent of box filled with bag: 90%; percent of bag filled with cornflakes: 90%; production cost: 9 cents; they would make double the profits! hooray! well thatâ\\x80\\x99s that. you know how people always have weird names on the interweb? well i came up with internet name generator! (random adjective)(random noun)(use a deck of cards for this part. take out the jokers and face cards, and tens are now zeros. pick out numbers until you get a club) additional things include: (pick a card. if it is three or lower, put x at the start and end)(pick a card. if it is an ace, replace noun with random country. if it is a two, replace noun with internet related company + fan.) let me try this. here is what i got: foulsoup31, xxinternalale10xx, strengthenedfillet49458, mediocreelectrode20, and epicredditfan7515. that was a lot more accurate than i thought it would be. bye. hello! i need to rant more! i am going to start a sentence without knowing where it is leading. i wish i could buy a mocha for my clown pants while aliens eat your toes which glisten in the sliver of wind. that was fun. why is orange so popular? there are so many words that donâ\\x80\\x99t rhyme with other words too, like engine, silver and angry (hangry isnâ\\x80\\x99t a real word as far as i know). and people know that orange rhymes with â\\x80\\x9cdoor hingeâ\\x80\\x9d! some people say that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t count. but there is another! sporangia! well, itâ\\x80\\x99s pretty close. i think itâ\\x80\\x99s like fern spores. well remember, whenever you see the color orange, type #boycottorange, so people stop taking pictures of orange things. for halloween, people will carve watermelons instead of pumpkins. trump will no longer be president because of his orange skin. oranges (the fruit) will be replaced by reds! (the soon to be fruit). the sun will disappear, or if we want to not go extinct, just change its color to blue. i have a map of europe on my wall, which has the countries in different colors. beware if you live in: the uk, spain, hungary, latvia, bosnia and herzegovina, greece, denmark and armenia. you guys will soon disappear off the face of the earth. and my favourite pop is club orange! nooooo! and jupiter will disappear too! now that i think about it, losing orange things wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be that bad compared to other colors. like blue. we would lose water, blue paint, the second book in the rust comic book series, the sky, pluto and that one triple angry bird. that would be awful. in section 255 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it states that the king of oddly colors farm animals (me again) will never make all blue things disappear, but he may make all orange things disappear. now you guys donâ\\x80\\x99t have to worry! :)! why are kings higher than queens in a deck of cards? thatâ\\x80\\x99s really sexist! people think that king is worth thirteen and queens are worth twelve! (if you canâ\\x80\\x99t tell, iâ\\x80\\x99m mocking that people that get offended by everything). why do vegetarians worry about hurting animals, but not plants!?!? plants have feelings too (i think)! in fact, vegetarians kill more than carnivores. instead of a whole family eating a chicken, if they are all vegetarians, then they will probably kill hundreds of plants! think about that, people! in this whole loteev, i have probably offended a lot of you guys. sorry bout that. in section 1029384756 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that if the mug of oddly colored farm animals (me again) offends any reader, he is sincerely sorry *citation not needed because of section 12345679 of the rfsh*. why are the money symbols not consistent? like thereâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x82¬uros, â¥en and â£ounds. but why $ollars? maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s supposed to be dollar$. that makes more sense. now i wonâ\\x80\\x99t get that nervous eye twitch every time i see that symbol. â\\x80\\x9chey look, i just found this ten dollar bill on the ground! hey why the flop is he doing that?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s justâ\\x80¦ a thing that he doesâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9coh.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9ci have a great idea for this! whenever he gets near money his eye twitches! that means we can find money on the ground just by watching him!â\\x80\\x9d and thatâ\\x80\\x99s how i lost all my friends. it turns out that was the only reason they liked me. wait what is this ?? that is so ?eird. goodbye. iâ\\x80\\x99m back! hahahaha gotcha! i was just kidding about that. but you would have never known that! iâ\\x80\\x99m going to try to make words using only the top row of letters. hmmmmâ\\x80¦ lets see. tip, rip, port, type, write, writer, typewriter. fascinating. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to make a fake movie trailer. using only words. here we go: [have you everâ\\x80¦]{scene of old woman churning milk}[wanted toâ\\x80¦]{scene of older woman churning what is now cream(the reason she is older is not because it is a different person, but because we filmed it after}[churn your own butter?!?!]{scene of even older woman churning what is now butter (the reason she is even older is because we got a new actor because the other one retired (she used to put tires on her vehicle, and now she does it again))}[this is a great movie, if you are an idiot][â\\x80\\x9cthis is a great movieâ\\x80\\x9d][i had popcorn while i watched this movie, and i really enjoyed it, it soothed the pain of having to watch that movie][â\\x80\\x9ci really enjoyed it, it really soothedâ\\x80\\x9d][i actually really enjoyed the movie!][waitâ\\x80¦ what? you know weâ\\x80\\x99re not paying you guys right? oh. anyway, â\\x80\\x9ci actually really enjoyed the movie!â\\x80\\x9d][while being on an oil rig?!?!]{wellâ\\x80¦ no, but anyway (shows a picture of an old woman churning butter which is thick and black and worth a lot more than butter)}[coming soon to you][this summer][and fall][and winter as well][lets just add spring too][the lard of the rigs] that was actually fun! {warning: if you use this movie name you will be sued actually now that i think about it you probably wonâ\\x80\\x99t. in fact, if you do actually make this into a movie, send it to me} do you guys think iâ\\x80\\x99m random enough? i really hope so! in section 5647382910 of the raflushe â\\x80\\x93 i canâ\\x80\\x99t remember. that challengey things name. but anyway, make that movie. plz. iâ\\x80\\x99m board. and not just any old barn-wood planks, mind you, but a board of fine stained oak as the flooring in the white house. by!!! iâ\\x80\\x99m back! no, just kidding, iâ\\x80\\x99m front! i have a topic that iâ\\x80\\x99m actually very serious about. puzzles. am i the only one that thinks that puzzles are the most useless thing in the world?!?! thatâ\\x80\\x99s like the proof that the human race have made it too far. when we actually make challenges that we have to face ourselves, and we pay for them! we are literally paying to give ourselves problems! we have enough problems! well at least i do ;). probprobprobprobleeeeeemsomomo! iâ\\x80\\x99m going to type something about politics to sound super cool. as you know, recently president obama (that was like years ago) ohâ\\x80¦ sozsozsoz. as you know, recently president nixon (no, thatâ\\x80\\x99s not exactly right) oh yea, i forgot. as you know, recently president lincoln (argh! we are not doing this anymore) was a president before donald (finally) duck! (nooooo! itâ\\x80\\x99s trump) what? no! you think youâ\\x80\\x99re sooo smart person who talks in the brackets. actually, trump is a businessman in that show where he says youâ\\x80\\x99re fired!!! what, you probably also think that a bodybuilder actor that says â\\x80\\x9cgeat touw thae chaeoppaerâ\\x80\\x9d is a governor too!?! hahahahaâ\\x80¦ donald duck was a great president. his slogan was â\\x80\\x9ci will fight for american democratsâ\\x80\\x9d and he bathes in gold. what a great job. money is so dirty though! now that i think about it, he probably gets the money wholesale from the mint. or else, how could he afford it?! i have a new segment in my text now! itâ\\x80\\x99s called the â\\x80\\x9crandom fun factâ\\x80\\x9d segment! (now that i think about it, i never know when to use those â\\x80\\x9c. i think itâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x9d when someone is talking and â\\x80\\x9d for saying something sarcastically or shortening a word. for example: â\\x80\\x9chello there chuckie! howâ\\x80\\x99ya doing â\\x80\\x98nice guyâ\\x80\\x99. were you being sarcastic? yes, but how could you see the little apostrophes when iâ\\x80\\x99m talking to you?â\\x80¦ science.â\\x80\\x9d and thatâ\\x80\\x99s how they work) where was i? random fax! i will send all of my readers a fax with has facts on in! how brilliant! the facts of the paragraph areâ\\x80¦ ice cream was invented in china, something that is â\\x80\\x98blueâ\\x80\\x99 (got it right there!) is actually every color but blue, and i like cheese. and the country of the paragraph isâ\\x80¦ mexico! why not, right? did you ever wonder how records work? (just in case you donâ\\x80\\x99t know, a record is a thingy where you put a round black thing on a majig and it puts a sharp whatchamacallit on that and funny rhythmic sound emerge and tickle your ear holes) i know how they work, with ridges and diaphragms and blah blah blah blah blahâ\\x80¦ but how do they work?!?! like who was sitting there in their layzboy having diet pepsi (or popsee to avoid copyright infringement (and thatâ\\x80\\x99s when i checked my forehead, and sure enough, there was a mint there)) and then they realiseâ\\x80¦ hey! bumpy things can make sounds! i just canâ\\x80\\x99t get my head around it (clockwise is my preference). do you ever wonder what the worst collections are in the world? i currently collect words, pins and the â\\x80\\x9cto kill a mockingbirdâ\\x80\\x9d series (not much work ( besides the fact that i have to give them (it) back to the library by tomorrow morning ( the last time i will ever bring a library book late again is when i borrowed the book entitled â\\x80\\x98how to sharpen a pencil for dummiesâ\\x80\\x99 (donâ\\x80\\x99t blame me! it was the â\\x80\\x98extended and revisedâ\\x80\\x99 edition! they had all the technical â\\x80\\x98lead vs. graphiteâ\\x80\\x99 stuff added.) an they called out my name over the loudspeaker telling me to return the book immediately or i would be fired (yes, i worked at the library (i never could figure out the dewey decimal system)). now that i think about it, they never said what book to bring, they just said my name. oh no, i never handed in the â\\x80\\x98how to sharpen a pen for dummiesâ\\x80\\x99 book! (which i rate a 3/5, â\\x80\\x9cwould not borrow againâ\\x80\\x9d because of its poor layout and overall structure (although the information was altogether helpful)) what collections do you have reader? find out next time on â\\x80\\x9cdeer or no deer!â\\x80\\x9d (remember forehead sweets) oh no! i wrote how to kill a mocking bird! i meant â\\x80\\x98pow do gill hamma (hammer) king turdâ\\x80\\x99. phew. got outta that one. i have a new topic! a high-quality, name-brand, box-not-bag topic! i figured out a great business plan! make onsies! not just out of clothes, but out of everything! like: did you eat two bowls of granola this morning? well onsie! [poured granola into one bowl, causing it to be crushed under its own weight] do you have two hands? well onsie! [handshakes himself] do you have twins? well onsie! [waitâ\\x80¦ how is this supposed to work?] get yours now at your local amazon (which might not be very accessible if you donâ\\x80\\x99t live in south america) for a free trial! *happy tune* onsie, onesie! life is better with a onsie. spin a web, less than two. onsie! (i think that was to the tune of spider-man (i mean smiter-can) onsies only costâ\\x80¦ whatever you want them to cost! yeah, i think iâ\\x80\\x99m going to go now. baiii! wait.. what? when did i wrote that onsie thing?? i just came back and i do not remember doing that. what the hat does â\\x80\\x98spin a web, less than twoâ\\x80\\x9d even mean? that is some weird stuff. so today i listened to that radio station again, and it was totally worth it. he was talking about these married people in germany that are going to a walking dead convention for their 17th anniversary. weird. weird, weird, weird!!! you know guitar tuna? probably not. it is an app where you tune your guitar (obviously). i thought of how they could make so much more money! if they had bass tuna, electric guitar tuna, acoustic guitar tuna. but they would all be the same thing!!! they would make so much money! wait. what about canned tuna! (also, if they thought in that way, then bass tuna would be extremely perplexing because they are both fish). well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s my stuff for today! hallo! iâ\\x80\\x99m back! and i donâ\\x80\\x99t get house decorations nowadays. people put old stuff in their house, and they think it makes it look amazing! people always talk about that â\\x80\\x98vintage lookâ\\x80\\x99 which is just putting old stuff that people fifty years ago would have said â\\x80\\x9cwhy do you have a *fill in the blank with an old thing* in your house?!?!â\\x80\\x9d in their house. i should rant. like what iâ\\x80\\x99m doing now. iâ\\x80\\x99m just talking about random things just like the flaming chicken person does just to fill up space on the page. i should also write long words like pnumonoultramicrkscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis and disestablishmentarianism . actually, since it only matters for words count, i should just type really small words. hi, my name is jo. (its not actually, but i need to type small words). i eat a lot of pie and i love it too. it is yum in my tum. wow that was probably really boring to read (and to write). hello there, reader! iâ\\x80\\x99ve just decided that i want to talk to you. i always seem to do all of the talking, but maybe i should give you a chance! *really really long drawn out super weird and uneventful awkward silence*. oh i see whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening. either you canâ\\x80\\x99t talk to me because you are in the future and iâ\\x80\\x99m in the past, causing us to not be able to communicate due to the sad reality that is the third dimension, orâ\\x80¦ your trying to talk to me on a walkie-talkie! i could never figure out those things either. theyâ\\x80\\x99re so confusing. lets seeâ\\x80¦ oh, there it is! the â\\x80\\x98walkie-talkie almanac: a complete collection of all the knowledge you will need to acquire (did you know acquire is also a board game? if you are ever playing, always buy america, and then buy quantum stocks (well it worked that one time i played (are you saying that games are different every time you play them!?!? (thatâ\\x80\\x99s the last time i mesmerise fifty-three rounds of go fish))) to use your very ownâ\\x80¦ walkie-talkie! (well what else would the walkie-talkie almanac be about!?!?) lets seeâ\\x80¦ contentsâ\\x80¦ it says the contents page is on page 1â\\x80¦ wait â\\x80\\x93 what?!?! the contents page has a line for the contents page! thatâ\\x80\\x99s like a website having a link to itself! (which is not a bad idea for my own website to get a lot of views (like i could a a tab on my website called â\\x80\\x9cthe best sites on the web! and i would have links to places like youtube and twitter (or whatever you youngâ\\x80\\x99uns go to these days! when i was a lad i used to play â\\x80\\x98pokã©mon pearlâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98facebookâ\\x80\\x99 now you kids are all on her newfangled â\\x80\\x98pokã©mon go get outta hereâ\\x80\\x99 and yer â\\x80\\x98snapperchattersâ\\x80\\x99 (i bet if you are reading this in ten years you wonâ\\x80\\x99t know that i was talking about pokemon go and snapchat (or how i got from talking to you to young ones (btw: if you are reading this in 2028 or beyond: welcome to the distant past! (now that in think about it, i started reading the longest text ever by â\\x80\\x98samâ\\x80\\x99 (real readers will know who that is) when it was about ten years too! and i don get the references to stuff like â\\x80\\x98neopetsâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98the matrixâ\\x80\\x99))))))) okay where is itâ\\x80¦ oh there; it says that the â\\x80\\x98pretty much how to use itâ\\x80\\x99 section is on page -3! well thats eas- how do i go to page -3! lets seeâ\\x80¦ oh look! they have a â\\x80\\x98how to go to negative pages section too! itâ\\x80\\x99s on page -7. noooo!! i guess iâ\\x80\\x99ll just look it up on the internet. ok first you have to turn the book into antimatterâ\\x80¦ ok got that doneâ\\x80¦ now just turn to the page without the negative! well that was easy. iâ\\x80\\x99m on page 7 now. it says all you have to do is convert the book into an antimatter form and- hey this sounds familiar! iâ\\x80\\x99ll go to page three now. it says here, and i quote: â\\x80\\x9cto use the walkie talkie, hold in that little button on the side o the walkie talkieâ\\x80\\x9d. did you that reader! can you try talking to me now? oh yes! i can hear you! oh wait, iâ\\x80\\x99m on the wrong station. iâ\\x80\\x99m on number five, but your on number six. i have to click a button to change my station number! too much work. do you think iâ\\x80\\x99m crazy because i talk to myself? iâ\\x80\\x99m not! yes you are. i am not! isnâ\\x80\\x99t talking to yourself the definition of crazy? iâ\\x80\\x99m not talking to myself. the who do you think i am? oh yea. iâ\\x80\\x99m your imaginary friend, ratguy! donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember me! no. oh *sniffle* well *odd breathing patterns* we *tear emerging from eyeball* used *pure weeping* to- i canâ\\x80\\x99t talk to you when your crying because you keep interrupting yourself! technically, since youâ\\x80\\x99re talking to yourself your also interrupting your self. i guess i am. continue, ratguy. as i was saying: we used to skate around on a skateboard together. we would have so much fun doing tricks that other kids could have only dreamed of, like the â\\x80\\x98ground ollieâ\\x80\\x99 and the â\\x80\\x98down-the-curbâ\\x80\\x99. we moved at speeds that the other kids couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even begin to imagine. 90% the speed of light. but ratguy?\\n\\nyes? if sewers moving at 90%!â\\x80¢ the speed of light, would the air compression deflecting us not cause us do develop into an expanding plasma fireball. this is a story, writer. stories donâ\\x80\\x99t have to â\\x80\\x98workâ\\x80\\x99. i need to stop!!! i keep writing all this nonsensical blubber and i canâ\\x80\\x99t stop. are you, the reader not so confused and uncomprehensive of what iâ\\x80\\x99ve just been typing to the last hour!?!? oh wait, you canâ\\x80\\x99t tell me if you were or not, your walkie-talkie isnâ\\x80\\x99t on the same channel as mine. i just realised something. i work hard to you guys trying to give you quality topics and extra-special rants. and how do people repay me? by writing more than me!!! i spend all day thinking about things that i want to put into this, and then i type it all up! and then i see that people want quantity, not quality! but no! you loyal readers will have to deal with me not writing 500 words a day, because iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking of things and stuff. i was just thinking, i need complain about my life more. thatâ\\x80\\x99s what all the people are doing nowadays. â\\x80\\x9coh, my life is so hard, i just broke a fingernail!â\\x80\\x9d big deal! â\\x80\\x9coh, my life is hard too, i just broke a fingerâ\\x80\\x9d bug real! â\\x80\\x9d oh my life is mildy uncomfortable and difficult, i broke all of my fingers, toes, limbs, necks, mothers vases, favourite guinness book of world records records, my most-used language rules, that kinda stuff. just in case you didnâ\\x80\\x99t realise, iâ\\x80\\x99m an introvert. so i have lots of problems withâ\\x80¦ people. and my guess is that you do too! so here are some crucial situations for you to read and laugh at me because you know i canâ\\x80\\x99t hear you! 1: you know when your talking to someone and you canâ\\x80\\x99t figure out what part of their face to look at? is it their eyes, or their nose, or their mouth? so then you kinda unfocus your eyes and stare in the middle of their face, like your looking right through them? and then they finished talking and you have no idea what they just said? cuz that happens to me all the time! 2: when your talking to someone and they are saying important stuff, but instead of listening to what theyâ\\x80\\x99re saying your just saying yes whenever they stop talking for a little bit? 3: when you are going into a building and there are people behind you, and you canâ\\x80\\x99t figure out if you should hold the door open for them or not? if you donâ\\x80\\x99t and theyâ\\x80\\x99re too close, it will probably hit him/her in the face but if you do and theyâ\\x80\\x99re to far, its really awkward because you are just standing there for a really long time. have any of these things happened to you? leave your answer in the comment section below! (there actually isnâ\\x80\\x99t one, i canâ\\x80\\x99t figure that much out). hedgehogs must find it really hard to have birthdays! if they have lots of balloons everywhere, they probably pop them; the police come because they think that its gunshots, and there goes all the hedgehogs friends. iâ\\x80\\x99m sure glad iâ\\x80\\x99m now a hedgehog! in section 333 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that free pop-proof balloons will be sent to any hedgehogs in need. well goodbye, iâ\\x80\\x99m off to slay a fantastic fedora fanatic! but before i go, i have to ask one thing. did you really make it this far? because if you have, the you have been promoted from herder of the rainbow fluffysheep to shearer of the rainbow fluffysheep. itâ\\x80\\x99s a title only few in the world have. did you know i also make comics? probably not, because i havenâ\\x80\\x99t posted any yet! well stay tuned for them someday. whatâ\\x80\\x99s up with everyone wanting to deep fry things? deep fried mars bars, deep fries cool aid! well iâ\\x80\\x99ve come up with a new food type! â\\x80\\x98shallow friedâ\\x80\\x99 available at all good pharmancy checkout lines beside the mayacamole and the taco sauce. (that sounds really good!(jut i case you didnâ\\x80\\x99t know, mayacamole is mayo and guacamole combined. doesnâ\\x80\\x99t that sound magically delicious!!!( i think it does))) shallow fried stuff has half the fat, uses half the â\\x80\\x98deep fry juiceâ\\x80\\x99 (whatever they put in there) and has have the flavour! for twice the price! even though we never had an original price. whatever. do you know whatâ\\x80\\x99s the worst? trying to buy computer â\\x80\\x93 related things in charity shops. i was at value village, and i saw a usb. it was 64 gigabytes! thatâ\\x80\\x99s pretty good (i bet if your are reading this in the distant future than you think that a 64 gigabyte usb is awful. well it isnâ\\x80\\x99t in this day and age) i thought, so i went to buy it. itâ\\x80\\x99s only two bucks! wow, what a steal. i looked closer at it and thatâ\\x80\\x99s when i realised. it said 64 megabytes!!! do you know how little that is! if you are from the distant future than you are probably thing â\\x80\\x98thatâ\\x80\\x99s like nothingâ\\x80\\x99 and youâ\\x80\\x99d be right. it can only store like 60 million letters! thatâ\\x80\\x99s only 15 million words! thatâ\\x80\\x99s only a million sentences! thatâ\\x80\\x99s only 200,000 paragraphs! thatâ\\x80\\x99s only 20,000 chapters! thatâ\\x80\\x99s only 1,000 books! thatâ\\x80\\x99s only 250 quadrilogies! now that i think about it, 250 quadrilogies isnâ\\x80\\x99t that bad. if you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell, i used a method called fermi estimation, though a little more precise. in fermi estimation, you can be off by 100x in either direction and it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really matter. according to fermi estimation, this is me. age: 10 number of eyes: 1 social security number: 1000000 pin code: 1000 number of limbs: 1 people in my family: 1 (forever alone). thatâ\\x80\\x99s why i like fermi estimation. i actually didnâ\\x80\\x99t tell you why i like it. oh well. where i live, they use blackcurrant in everything. itâ\\x80\\x99s pretty much a replacement for grape. but am i the only one who thinks that grape flavoured things taste way better? whenever i get something blackcurrant flavoured i offer it someone, because they usually like it (and i hate it). works well for me!! i was just thinking about tides. way back in the day, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t tides make no sense? the sea would just get higher and lower and there was no reasoning behind it. maybe thatâ\\x80\\x99s why they thought sea monsters existed. no what i think about it though, the moon pulling on the water is kinda even crazier than that. and now for a commercial break. kshhhhhh â\\x80\\x93 tacosâ\\x80¦â\\x80¦ i love em! and you can to for only ten easy payments of ten bucks! (thatâ\\x80\\x99s deer by the way) tacos can make you feel fuzzy in the inside. thatâ\\x80\\x99s because of the mould that comes free with every purchase! and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no artificial additives either! (we did that by adding so many additives that instead of adding it to the taco, we were technically adding the taco to the additives). what are you waiting for! iâ\\x80\\x99m waiting for this commercial to end so i can get paid! call now at 1800-got-punk to order a taco from teddys tacos (or would it be teddies) and you will get a free rent-a-friend with your purchase! but thereâ\\x80\\x99s more! order now and get a free ferrari too! oh it seems our lines are down its too late. theyâ\\x80\\x99re back up again! but itâ\\x80\\x99s too late! i use too many exclamation marks! but thereâ\\x80\\x99s more! be the 7.8ã\\x9710^9 customer to order to get a free home with your choice of a happy meal toy! kshhhhhh . i think that people complain about preservatives way to much. they all say â\\x80\\x9coh, itâ\\x80\\x99s soooo unhealthyâ\\x80\\x9d but i think that month-past-the-expiration-date-food is way more unhealthy. the end of that. goodbye.do you do two extra languages in school? if so you will know what i mean. every time i have to study for one language, i always remember the word from the other language! like when iâ\\x80\\x99m learning japanese iâ\\x80\\x99ll think what was â\\x80\\x98how are youâ\\x80\\x99 again? oh yea, itâ\\x80\\x99s frickin ã\\x87a va!!! (sorry if iâ\\x80\\x99m being too edgy) in section 250q4 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it states that english is the best language and no one should be forced to learn any other. if they are, they must fill up a bath tub with alpabits which spell out the word that they uttered and eat all of it without any sugar sprinkled on top (nooooo). that sounded a little bit clichã©. go to the tub young man! ok. well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all i got for today. see ya! iâ\\x80\\x99m back here again! another hour of my life will be wasted in the next fewâ\\x80¦ minutes? that previous (the auto correct is so bad on this phone it corrected previous to peeler oohs) sentence made no sense whatsoever. i have a conspiracy for you guys today! (or 4 u guys 2day if i want to sound â\\x80\\x98hipâ\\x80\\x99). donâ\\x80\\x99t worry, itâ\\x80\\x99s not as long as that illuminati one (although i was thinking about doing another one of those soon. so stay tuned!). i think school is a scam! have you ever noticed that everyone says that the government is trying to brainwash people? well the last place you would think to look for that kind of activity is a government-funded learning program! the government is trying to teach people nonsense to make the population stupid. like when will i ever need to know about the themes and plot devices in to kill a mockingbird? or how to calculate the area under a curve? or even that in 1812 a war happened that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t affect me today! they could be teaching us important things, like how to pay bills, how to get a job, how to overthrow the government and all political world leaders for entire globe domination, how to use bendy straws, you know, the important stuff! (by the way, one of those things was not like the others). that was my conspiracy. i donâ\\x80\\x99t think that anyone has actually read to this far. i donâ\\x80\\x99t actually have any proof that anyone has. but if you have, here is proof. a tiny quiz to test how well you really know this loteev. email all the answers to me atrainbowflufysheep123@gmail.com, for a chance to win a response from me and a chance to tell me what you think of this site! (actually, no matter what i will respond though) lets get started. question 1: what emoji is â\\x80\\x98creepyâ\\x80\\x99? question 2: what type of plant will i make america covered in when i become president? question 3: fill in he blank. jumping _____ ate many jars containing marmalade. question 4: what is the worst molecule to be? question 5: how many tiny changes to a cereal box do you need to make it half the price? question 6: what did i rate the book entitled â\\x80\\x98how to sharpen a pen for dummiesâ\\x80\\x99? question 7: what page is the â\\x80\\x98how to go to negative pagesâ\\x80\\x99 section on in the walkie-talkie almanac? question 8: what year was the brand new ford mustang bike? question 9: what is â\\x80\\x98a fun game on the playstation 2â\\x80\\x99 question 10: what food was described as â\\x80\\x98ok, bobâ\\x80\\x99? if you got all of those questions right than you are a true reader of the loteev! and you get a prize! if you send me your answers at rainbowfluffysheep123@gmail.com, you will get your name mentioned in this loteev? (i mean, if you want). if your like me and have a lonely youtube channel with five views because you watched it five times, the his is the prize for you! anyway, enough with that. an i the only person that thinks buying name brand stuff is dumb? people are pretty much paying to advertise a company. people want the logo for the company because it looks â\\x80\\x98coolâ\\x80\\x99. what if you bought a shirt from the dump? would you want it to have a â\\x80\\x98the dumpâ\\x80\\x99 logo on it? (actually, i have no idea what point i was trying to make). i once heard a saying: you arenâ\\x80\\x99t popular if you spend a thousand dollars on a jacket, but you at if the company that makes it spend a thousand dollars for you to wear it. (now that i think about it i feel like i may have possibly made that up). you get what iâ\\x80\\x99m saying though? i hope you do. well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s my stuff for today. see ya! iâ\\x80\\x99m back! and do i got stuffs to say! do you personally know anyone who uses exercise balls for their intended purpose? either we play soccer with them, or we bowl with them, or we throw them really hard at people. now that i think about it for a little bit, what is an exercise balls intended purpose? iâ\\x80\\x99ll leave that question for you guys to figure out! have you heard about that new law that teachers are allow to have guns in schools? i donâ\\x80\\x99t know what your opinion is on that subject, but i think itâ\\x80\\x99s an awful idea, at least in my school. for reference, here is a clip of a conversation between my construction and my english teacher. i will name the construction teacher mr. hardy and the english teacher ms. poema: â\\x80\\x9chey ms. poema, have you heard about that new â\\x80\\x98teachers are allowed to have guns in schoolâ\\x80\\x99 law?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cin fact i have mr. hardyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9d i canâ\\x80\\x99t wait to have mine. iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna get one of the big ones too, so i can take down the whole class in one go.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m gonna get one of those little ones that you can hide in your sockâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cbut then youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to take down the students one at a time!â\\x80\\x9d now iâ\\x80\\x99m no â\\x80\\x98expertâ\\x80\\x99 on education, but is it even legal for teachers to say stuff like that? i thought it was funny, but what if there was a new student at school that day, and they thought that the teachers were psychos!?!? the students already there are used to their teachers being like that though. i have more evidence that the teachers here are crazy! one day my brother borrowed a camera from the school, and mr. hardy (what a coincidence) had to collect it from him when he was done. mr. hardy said that if he didnâ\\x80\\x99t bring back the camera by tomorrow, he would have to emigrate to a muslim country where he would be covered from head to toe, and mr. hardy would personally be sent from the school board to seek him out and assassinate him! itâ\\x80\\x99s just a camera, calm down mr. hardy. and the next day he went up to him and said he must have brought the camera back, or else he would be hiding in the trenches of afghanistan!!! and thatâ\\x80\\x99s why i didnâ\\x80\\x99t do construction in school (and because i wasnâ\\x80\\x99t good at it). thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough about my crazy life. bye!!! itâ\\x80\\x99s been a really long time (like a week). and i just thought of something great. isnâ\\x80\\x99t cereal actually a soup? well now youâ\\x80\\x99re going to be thinking about that for the rest of your life :). iâ\\x80\\x99m going to addition to the rfsrqp (the rainbow fluffysheep rhetorical questions page). also to be added: are there more hard things or soft things in the world? what is the average size of a rock? what is the meaning of life? does nine plus ten truly equal twenty-one? why do whales have blowholes? what colour is the dress? how long is a fortnite? how long is a pubg? how is plastic made from oil? how is oil made from dead stuff? why do people eat cheetos if they get that orange dust everywhere? why do people celebrate pi day but not tau day? these are all important question you need to ask yourself. i know the answer to one of them. itâ\\x80\\x99s because it sounds like pie, if half of pi was called kaek, they would probably celebrate it too. iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry to say guys, but i have finally and truly decided to stop writing this loteev. i have to pursue other things, like my life. goodbye foreverâ\\x80¦. â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80¦ april fools!!! hahaha! april fools fool! today is april fools day and i have so many ideas. so far these are my dubious schemes: i have turned only one corner of my brothers rubikâ\\x80\\x99s cube to render it unsolvable (the only way is to take it apart), put the movie in the dvd player upside down so it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t play, and i stole my brothers easter egg (as i say it now that last one doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really seem like a prank). but he got me back, because he: put an avocado in the coffee maker, tied a air refreshener to the door so when you open it it sprays everywhere, and threatened me with a knife that turned out to just be a comb. isnâ\\x80\\x99t it great? i have a weird family. hey! we were all lied to in kindergarten! remember you teacher always used to say to you â\\x80\\x9cremember children, i before e, except after c!â\\x80\\x9d weâ\\x80\\x99ll you were scammed! take the word â\\x80\\x98weirdâ\\x80\\x99 as an example. see what wrong here!?!? it has the i after e, and not after c! now if you donâ\\x80\\x99t trust the school system then i donâ\\x80\\x99t know what your doing with your brain. you should go on strike! i just fit in the second â\\x80\\x98pieceâ\\x80\\x99 of the puzzle! when i was little, i use to always say â\\x80\\x9cif it rhymes its trueâ\\x80\\x9d. that was like my motto! and secretly, you could manipulate any sentence to succumb to the malevolent power of that prestigious rule. you could say â\\x80\\x9cbroccoli is bad, so they say; and it rhymes so it is true today!â\\x80\\x9d but then you could also say â\\x80\\x9cice-cream is good, so they say; and it rhymes so it is true today!â\\x80\\x9d. see what i did there? i thought that it was genius! until it got used against me. all i had to do was change the rule to â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s true if it rhymes, but only sometimesâ\\x80\\x9d. and that worked perfectly. fun fact of the paragraph: leicester is actually not pronounced lay-ches-ter. itâ\\x80\\x99s les-ter. that makes no sense whatsoever! i still thought you would like to know that. i have a great idea! i should talk about my middle school! ah, way back in the day that was. when i was a wee 13 year old lad. there used to be this bench at the school where people would go to make a friend. i think people were supposed to come and invite them to play a game. but what really happened is that people would just walk past and shout â\\x80\\x9cloner!!!â\\x80\\x9d whenever someone was sitting there. and they were henceforth called â\\x80\\x98the loner benchesâ\\x80\\x99. itâ\\x80\\x99s a cruel world we live in. also, there were bushes with really long leaves that we used to make bows there too. we would tie it to a stick, and then we sharpened another stick to use as an arrow. we must have had five bows and fifty arrows at the time. we hid them all under a tree, so no one would steal them. until one day, some random person ran in stole a bow and arrow, and shot it at a teacher. and thatâ\\x80\\x99s how that ended. now that i think about this school, i donâ\\x80\\x99t think we ever really learned anything there. also, herb is pronounced erb. weird stuff, right? i have a very important, strange question for you. why are there so many fast food restaurants that are exactly the same? whatâ\\x80\\x99s the point? ask yourself that question 5 â\\x80\\x93 7 times a day, 3 â\\x80\\x93 4 times a week, 2 â\\x80\\x93 4 times a month, 12 times a year. ( you can take leap day off if you want ( although if you do you might find yourself in a burger king contemplating life ( while also contemplating if $3.99 for 6 chicken wings is better than $6.99 for 10 ( and if the ketchup packets are free with a soft drink ( and if you ask that if the employee will look at you with utter bewilderment ( has this ever happened to you? you are squirting your ketchup into your coke when you realiseâ\\x80¦ how much do i put in!?!? i read on reddit to put 2.3 packets per 7.9 ounces of coke, and a kilogram is 2.2 pounds, so that mean 5.4 packets per kilometre per hour (ppkph) and there is 39 miles in a light nano-second andâ\\x80¦ ahhhhhhh!!! well try the new pre-mixed ketchoke! it has that perfect flavour, time after time! ketchoke: not copyrighted! ( warning: you might choke))))))). in europe m&mâ\\x80\\x99s are actually really healthy. believe it or not, there are like six vegetables in one bag of m&mâ\\x80\\x99s. instead of using dyes like red133 and blue423, they use stuff like beetroots. isnâ\\x80\\x99t that amazing / awful depending on what type of person you are. in land of the lost one of the characters is eating a donut filled with m&mâ\\x80\\x99s and another person asks what heâ\\x80\\x99s doing. he says â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m eating a donut filled with m&mâ\\x80\\x99s so i donâ\\x80\\x99t have to eat m&mâ\\x80\\x99s after i eat my donutâ\\x80\\x9d. i thought you would like to know that fun fact. i have a conspiracy! owls are trying to make us dumb! people always say owls are wise! but how wise can someone be who has six toes!!! six is equal to half a dozen. the reason i think owls are dumb is because i hate when people say half a dozen. what a big waste of time! i am so angry and that is why i am using capital letters!!! half a dozen is four syllables, and six is only one. so when someone says half a dozen, i just think â\\x80\\x9coh wow, youâ\\x80\\x99re just trying to waste my timeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cduring that .5 of a second you spent saying that i could have twiddled my thumbs 3,4 times, or seen every main naruto character in a 60 fps environment, or listen to the first two notes of crazy frogâ\\x80\\x9d. now that i think about it, during the time i made that rant about half a dozen loathing, i could have listened to the first three notes of crazy frog (duh duh duh. skip ahead to the chorus of that song.. crazy frog!!!) hello. i have a topic for you today. i was having a dream and in it there was a pink sticky note. already fascinating! but on it was handwritingâ\\x80¦ that i couldnt read. how could my brain write words that i couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even read??? life makes no sense. or as antvenom would say; life makes no sense?! fun fact of the paragraph: 2 to 3 times a week is almost the same as every 2 or 3 days. wahoo! next time you buy a freddo or a banana-flavoured-freddo choco bar then rememberâ\\x80¦ eat it every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 or 3 times a day! (wait thats not rightâ\\x80¦) actually â\\x80\\x93 just eat your freddo!! and now a special announcment: this is a shoutout to the not very helpful secrets of things corporation! or the nvhsotc. which means nothing. it is a company which makes things like the little tabs at the sides of cling film boxes. no-one knows about these things, but they â\\x80\\x98helpâ\\x80\\x99 people. also, they make things like handles on flashlights that double as a stand so the poor little electrons burst into the sky helplessly, uselessly. without this company, the world would simply not be the same!!! if donate ?5 to this company, or $4.815162342 (i hope those dollars dont get lost in the mail hehehe) then you can save a turkey from strep throat. the end. goodbye!!! if you have made it this far into the official loteev, then you get the official rainbow fluffysheep badge of honour!!! (um, this isnt a badgeâ\\x80¦ its just a piece of plastic with your face on it!! go ahead, put it on your lappel next to your badge of boy scouts for not being sexist and letting girls into boy scout (speaking of this: they changed canadaâ\\x80\\x99s national anthem from â\\x80\\x9call thy sons commandâ\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9call thy peoples commandâ\\x80\\x9d. why would they do that? did the â\\x80\\x98aâ\\x80\\x99 really need to be capitalised??) but how can i if there is nothing to stick it with? would you like a knife perhaps? no, anything else! i havenâ\\x80\\x99t trusted you with knives ever since you tried to butter your toast and ended up slicing milly the catâ\\x80\\x99s third whisker to the left. actually, i donâ\\x80\\x99t need this badge. donâ\\x80\\x99t worry! take this â\\x80\\x93 sqquuiisshh â\\x80\\x93 (takes gum from mouth (tutti frutti flavour coincidentally (actually not coincidentally because this is fictional and i made it up to emulate the story (and it is altogether irrelevant anyway (some gum says its good for your teeth, so i guess it is coinci-dental!

(i guess that would be a problem at foot actually). car pedals are so wierd because there is a brake, clutch and gas. i always thought that there was a forwards and a backwards! (well, until like five years ago). sad how this world has to make simple things so complicated. there must be thousands of buttons on a plane, when all it needs is up, down, right, left, forwards, backwards, cupholder eject, radio station changer, barrel roll, mince meat dispenser and two parachutes just for the captain because they donâ\\x80\\x99t care about the passengers. donâ\\x80\\x99t you hate it when you are typing a list with commas and you get to the last word of the list and you realise you forgot to put an and before it?!?! e.g. the colours of a rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet (oh no i was supposed to put an and there) indigo and violet. there ya go, a real fwp (first world problem (theres so many abbreviations nowadays that eventually theres going to be no words, just abbreviations)). isnâ\\x80\\x99t it weird that the ukelele strings arenâ\\x80\\x99t in order? it goes ding dong dong ding. i wonder how that got invented? it was probably some smart guy inventing an ultra-efficient stringed-instumentplaying device when his dumb friend walks up and says what does this knob do? and the he goes bwowowowow. yep, i guarantee you thats how it happened. are you in a car right now and you are bored and its raining? pick a raindrop on the window and race it against another one. itâ\\x80\\x99s great! or you could just keep reading this, which is probably even more great. you could just read this forever. if you ever get to the end, then that means you are reading faster than iâ\\x80\\x99m typing. which is actually really easy. right now iâ\\x80\\x99m at the end of this loteev. there is nothing but an endless abyss of void past these very words. until i write more, that is. do you know what is a great topic to ruin your fail routine? what makes me not sleep at night. and the answer may surprise youâ\\x80¦ blankets. thunk about it. the fully stuff in the inside is feathers. duck feathers. they kill the duck!!! or they just skin him. but have you ever seen a featherless duck?? exactly. skinning them would probably be worse then killing them. thy would be so ashamed to walk in public featherless. unless they live in a hot country like spain, in which case the featherless ducks are the cool ones. noooo!!! i just realised that blankets actually are made of weird fluffy stuff, while pillows are made of feathers. so actually pillows are what keep me awake at night. but they also keep me asleep because thats their job. its a paradox!!! like shrã¶deners cat. im always half awake and half asleep at the same time. although iâ\\x80\\x99m closer to asleep at school. because they donâ\\x80\\x99t have pillows. if you cant sleep, i have a game for you, yes you. scribble on a page, then colour in the spaces with two alternating colours so the colours arenâ\\x80\\x99t touching. it looks so cool too. i have a consiracy. ice-cream!!! it hurts so much!!! the government has hidden tiny knives inside of ice-cream to stab your teeth! its eeevil!!! they do this because then dentists get more money, which in turnâ\\x80¦ in turn causes theâ\\x80¦ the government toâ\\x80¦ lose money. nevermind, this conspiracy has been proven false by the conspiracys are really stupid commission, or cows. i guess that would be weally stupid. right now it is al the back in the year 2018. hello from the distant past! i think ive typed enough for now. bye!!! im back! with some more wwiieerrdd things for you! i was casually walking around, doing my own thing, eating a burrito (i actually wasnâ\\x80\\x99t, but it adds mystery to this tale) when two people walked past me. â\\x80\\x9cwhat you have to is multiply the elephants by five, and divide by threeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9coh, i was so close!â\\x80\\x9d. now you reader try to figure out what they were talking about. (ps: you cant! hahaha!). and thats what happened today. woohoo! iâ\\x80\\x99m so happy. i have overcome my boundaries in c++ three times today. first, i put a function into a header file. next, i saved multiple pieces of data into one text file. then, i saved an array to a text file. hooray! if you know about c++ then you will be excited for me.\\n\\n\\ni know what you are thinking. how did you get that much doneâ\\x80¦ on a school day!? and this is what happened. i was getting up to go to school, like normal when suddenly (dramatic music) i turned (dramatic music builds) and saw (dramatic music at the climax) that i had to leave in ten minutes. (dont worry, this doesnâ\\x80\\x99t end up being my fault, or else i wouldnt tell this story). i was ready in ten minutesâ\\x80¦ like a boss!!! and then i realisedâ\\x80¦ no-one was driving us to school. huh. and thats what happened. my parents woke up and two-o-clock. pm. like they donâ\\x80\\x99t care about our education. it was the best day ever! i coded for five hours. the end of that story, and a word from our sponsor. #include â\\x80\\x9clifesimulator.hâ\\x80\\x9d void life(socialsecuritynum){ if (youremotion == â\\x80\\x9cboredâ\\x80\\x9d && bool havejob == â\\x80\\x9cfalseâ\\x80\\x9d){cout << â\\x80\\x9ccome and work at the c++ factory, where we code robots to take your job!!!; havejob = true; youremotion = â\\x80\\x9chappyâ\\x80\\x9d;} else {cout << â\\x80\\x9clife is great!â\\x80\\x9d;}}. do you want to work at â\\x80\\x98stealyourownjobâ\\x80\\x99? the only problem is that the best employees get fired the fastest. see ya! guess what my loyal fansâ\\x80¦ im halfway through the world record!!! now, if i really want to win, all i have to do is double the amount of words. im im halfway halfway through through the the world world record record!!! !!! that would make for a really stupid thing to read though. has anyone printed this loteev off? seeing as most novels are 70,000 words or something like that, you my loyal reader, could easily print off 18,500 words. maybe you could make a coffee table book. donâ\\x80\\x99t steal my works and post it on another website (actually, your website is probably too high standard for this nonsense). every reproduction of this text must have a copyright notice as following: copyrighted and trademarked and patented an registered and stuff to rainbowfluffysheep ltd. it hereby states in the rainbow fluffysheep handbook section 123a, b and c that (a) this is the coolest loteev ever (b) cheese is a vegetable and (c) that you may tell your friends about the loteev, so long as the words emitted from your mouth do not consist of up to and include 50% of the total text from which it is derived (iâ\\x80\\x99d like to see you try though (and id like to see if you have a friend because i need them ð\\x9f\\x98¦ (that would have been really creepy if i wrote â\\x80\\x98i need them ;)â\\x80\\x99 ))). anyway, gotta go, cuz its may the second, and you know what that meansâ\\x80¦ may the second be with you!!! chairsâ\\x80¦ theyâ\\x80\\x99re great for sitting in, arenâ\\x80\\x99t they? do you remember when fidget spinners were all the rage? kids all around the globe were spinning plastic toys. and all the adults were like, â\\x80\\x9cwow, those are the most useless toys ever!!!â\\x80\\x9d but what i think is that their toys were just as bad! think about jacks, those little spiky things with the other round things that your throw and bounce them. how is that any better!?!? anyway, iâ\\x80\\x99m just saying donâ\\x80\\x99t be so judge judy (which is a great show (because you get to watch that big person swing a meat-hammer at a table (iâ\\x80\\x99ve always wanted to do that))) all the time. is time really a dimension? because you can only move forwards in it. imagine if you coulde only move forwards in the third dimension at the same rate. you would get squished with alot of walls. but, you could go back in time, to make up for the lot dimension. perfect! i have a newâ\\x80¦ conspiracy! you know those pillow where if you put them on one end they are dark and on the other end they are shiny? i think that the government has hidden thousands of tiny cameras facing upwards into the pillows, and the shiny parts are just the lenses for them reflecting light. so if you happen to own any of these said pillows, throw them away!! or elseâ\\x80¦ you will be watched. in section 747 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it states that you should cut all the wires coming out of your pillows, because they are probably connected to a van outside your house. if there are no wires, then they are probably using radiowaves; in which case you should insert your pillow into an untainted lead box. hopefully you donâ\\x80\\x99t care that your pillow is now heavy, hard, cold and poisonous. you know how adults also say shooting games are â\\x80\\x9cdangerously mind-alteringâ\\x80\\x9d? well i bet in world war two the parents didnâ\\x80\\x99t say to their kids: â\\x80\\x9chey jimmy?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cyea, momma?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cwhatcha doin my lad?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cim peelin me potaytoes and them iâ\\x80\\x99m going to feed the cattleâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cjo i mean with your lifeâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9coh right mam! im goâ\\x80\\x99n awf to wawr with my buds!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cbut war is dangerously mind-altering my sonny-boy!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cumâ\\x80¦ ya.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cim very disappointed in you. soon your going to be living in my basement eating fatcakes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cbut ma, im fightin for awr country!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cwar is so violent though!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cumâ\\x80¦ ya.â\\x80\\x9d you get the picture. teenagers need violence in their lives! if we cant get it by going to war, then either we play violent video-games or we beat strangers!! which one would you choose now, stereotypical adults!!! (see how i slowly increased the exclamation marks to increase the intensity (!!!!)). also, adults always say stuff like â\\x80\\x9clookie here, cabbage is a new superfood!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9chowdya know ma?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cit what they say nowadaysâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cwhat time is nowadays ma?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c1945â\\x80\\x9d (coincidentally the same family apparently) but whoâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98theyâ\\x80\\x99 think about that, and listen to how often people say that. i have asked close personal relations and he / she stated that â\\x80\\x9cits probably some group of scientists or something in wisconsinâ\\x80\\x9d. really? wisconsin? thats probably why â\\x80\\x98theyâ\\x80\\x99 say that cheese is unhealthy an im only allowed one laughing cow a day! (you would eat alot too if you got ptsd from a laughing cow (imagine you are just loitering around a fast food shop, eating fillet piggoin (dont ask (it was on sale for half price ok!)) when suddenly a cow sneaks up behind you and makes a 200-decible half moo half evil laugh (like this: mmwoaohoaohoa))) thats what â\\x80\\x98theyâ\\x80\\x99 sound like. see ya!!! im back, with a thimble-load of structural wisdom! and my question to you readers is this: is garlic a fruit? just wondering. i donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to type! ahhhhhh! i have typed my mental breakdowns to soothe them. ahhh. ahh. ah. ahhh!!! nevermind. you know those shopping carts at stores that cost a quarter? i always went to those to see if anyone left their money in. and i got one once! you should try it. its so satisfying when you find one. one. only one. buy a pencil or something to reward yourself. make sure its a 6b pencil, so you donâ\\x80\\x99t put any strain on your eyes. or your wrist-muscles. i just found the degree button! there is a door open at a 45â° angle that is 45â° celsius (its probably in arizona or something). do coats keep you warm, or do they preserve heat? i think its the ladder (it is (the ladder i mean (the latter i mean (wait, is it the latte or the ladder? (the former))))) so that means if you put a coat on a snowman it would keep him alive longer! ill start a new charity; coats for melting snowmen: saving snowmen lives one water droplet at a time!! see yaaaaaaa.:.this isâ\\x80¦ a new beginning to the loteev on a new phone! although it will be added to the original loteev, this part will be a new beginning, a fresh chronicle!!! but donâ\\x80\\x99t worryâ\\x80¦ nonsense is 100% guaranteed! more like 1 ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 % guaranteed! i just had a scary thought. they say can buy everything, but i know one thing it canâ\\x80\\x99t buy â\\x80\\x93 a trip to the summit of mount everest!! no matter what you cant get to the summit unless you climb yourself. even a helicopter can barely make it to the base camp!! i cant believe humans havent made something to do that yet. unlessâ\\x80¦ you could land the iss on it! perfect!! that would definetly work. i should make my own subreddit. before i begin on this wonderful journey, i must inform you, the reader, what a subreddit is. as far as you know, a sub-reddit is just a burger at burger-galaxy (this is the cringiest sci-fi failure youll ever read). he are some examples of subreddits: r/whooooooosh (i cant remember how many oâ\\x80\\x99s there are) eg. { joe: this is the best joke ever! â\\x80\\x94 cashier: are you going to pay for that chocolate bar? customer: i dont have any money ð\\x9f\\x98¦ cashier: then put it back! customer: *slides cashier a 20* lets keep this between us ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 â\\x80\\x94 bob: why didnt he just pay for the chocolate bar? jim: r/whooooosh }. next subreddit is: r/atetheonion. heres the backstory: the onion is a fake news site, which posts funny news. if you fall for that news, you are said to have â\\x80\\x9cate the onionâ\\x80\\x9d. eg. { the onion: new studies show that drinking can lower thirst by up to 96% bob: everyone knows this this is so stupid!!! jim: r/atetheonion } what am i doing? why donâ\\x80\\x99t you just look it up on the internet!?!? r/facepalm i have to stop. so my subreddit will be, r/rainbowfluffysheep. who wouldve thought!?!? in it there will bâ\\x80\\x94 we interupt your normal daily fluffysheep to bring you an urgent news report: farm animals of all kinds are raging across the streets! we cant figure out why; one cameraman suggested they were on strike against meat production practices. i just got word that we will be speaking to a memebr of this protest shortly. standbyâ\\x80¦ ok, so why are you commencing with this protest sir baababaaa? ba ba baa baaa. baa baaa baaa!!! baa baâ\\x80\\x94 we inturupt this interuption to bring you back your regulary scheduled program. â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x94 we at fluffysheep studios dont care about animal protests! we will eat all the beef jerky we want! right guys! guys! *sniffling in the background. a slight whimper. a deep voice. a thickened plot.* actually [unknown], we have all been deeply moved by the actions these animals are taking. thusâ\\x80¦ we have all become vegans. *[unknown]â\\x80\\x99s mind is blown (thats me by the way)* wellâ\\x80¦ i gues ill eat this beef jerky by myself then. *crinkles the packet*. many evil stares. *pulls it open*. someone starts pounding his fists. *takes out a jerky*. someone comes over very close â\\x80\\x93 so close you could smell the vegan on him. my heart is beating. what will happen to me if i eat this beef jerky!? or worse.. if i dont. will i become one of them!? thats a risk im just not willing to take. ba bum. ba bum. ba bum. *brings the jerky towards his mouth*. ba bum. ba bum. *opens his mouth*. everyone from around the building is now watching him. ba bum. ba bum. *chew* find out what happens next time onâ\\x80¦ the loteev â\\x80\\x94 animals strike â\\x80\\x93 in more ways than one!! im back! and today iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be talking about a very different scenario. i need to talk more about real life conspiracies if i need to keep my readers interested!! and these may not just be conspiracies, mind you, but a new kind of segment for my beloved reader(s) (i read this, sooooo) called learning about scams and trying to use them to trick my readers into reading more! so i heard about this new scam( never mind its actually old( like your mother( iâ\\x80\\x99m hilarious, i know( and possibly quite offensive))) where you get say ten people to each give you â\\x82¬10, and you give them â£15 back. ( iâ\\x80\\x99m just going explain this now, but throughout this demonstration iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be changing the currency symbol for comedic effect, but now that i think about it, explaining it ruins what little comedic effect what there at all, but iâ\\x80\\x99m going to keep all of this anyways : ] ) and then you get 20 people to give you $20 each and you give them â¥30 back. and then you get 100 people to give you @100 each and you donâ\\x80\\x99t pay them back! what a plan! you get to keep &10,000 in the end, which i think is a great idea. bu how could i do that with words, you may ask? leave your question in the comments down below ( and also your answer to your comments because a busy writer like me doesnâ\\x80\\x99t heed to your delusion of getting a response from an esteemed author and self-published poet of sorts) and keep reading, because i have a possible solution. just replace the money with characters randomly typed by an assistant writer named bilbo ( yes, he is a money of course, we need these characters to be truly random, i cant count on technologyâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98this is random because we get extremely precise measurements of radiationâ\\x80\\x99 shtick anymore ). while you try to figure out how that would ever work, ill be swiftly moving on to a new, more exciting and reasonable topic, such asâ\\x80¦ figure out the movie!! there once was a cat. he sat on a mat. the catâ\\x80\\x99s face has a striking similarity to that of leonardo de caprio. the mat is a dream. the mat is another cats mat. the mat, when opened, contains another mat inside. both mats are very real depictions of a real mat, but are both not real. somehow, another mat is inside the second mat. most cats thought that this was impossible. there is a cat named joe who owns a bowl filled with a dry collection of the most cat food in the house, which goes by the name of kittynibbles. when joe dies, he leaves his son, who is still just a kitten named bob, the entire bowl of kittynibbles. joe must decide whether to eat the bowl of kittynibbles, by pouring milk on the food, liquidating it into a scrumptious snack, or keeping to dry kittynibbles for others and future kitten alike. another kitten, a fairly shrewd manx cat called â\\x80\\x98the black pawsâ\\x80\\x99 was hired by another cat, who has a large portion of kittynibbles himself. the problem for the hiring cat, a tabby named â\\x80\\x98fluffballâ\\x80\\x99, is that his large supply isnâ\\x80\\x99t vast enough to outweigh bobs, making it the second largest collection of kittynibbles in the whole house. the reason fluffball needs to hire bp is to convince bob that joe wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve wanted him to eat his nibbles, because of itâ\\x80\\x99s great nutritional value. if he does eat it, the fluff would have a monopoly of sorts on his selling of knibbles for toys such as tons of rubber mice. to convince bob that thats what joe wouldve wanted, they set up a trick where they make a puppet of joe talking to bob, and he assumes he must be alive and these are his final words, to liquidate the kittynâ\\x80\\x99s. the thing is, the puppet of joe is made of two mats stuck together, but there is a problem. bob might not believe that the two stuck together mats are really joe, because he isnt sitting on his favourite mat. team bp knows that this has to work first time, so they found the technology they needed, a third mat. but when stiching the mats together, bp realised that he has lice and termites in his fur, which are eating away at the mats. he need to find another cat who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have termites who can sew as good as he can. the plot thickensâ\\x80¦.. while you figure that out, iâ\\x80\\x99ll be sleeping, see ya : ) ///// i will not explain: â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x93 there once was a cat. he sat on a mat. the catâ\\x80\\x99s name? leonardo de caprio. the mat is a dream. the mat is another cats mat. the mat, when opened, contains another mat inside. both mats are very real depictions of a real mat, but are both not real. somehow, another mat is inside the second mat. most cats thought that this was impossible. there is a cat named joe who owns a bowl filled with a dry collection of the most cat food in the world, which goes by the name of kittynibbles. when joe dies, he leaves his son, who is still just a kitten named bob, the entire bowl of kittynibbles. joe must decide whether to eat the bowl of kittynibbles, by pouring milk on the food, liquidating it into a scrumptious snack, or keeping to dry kittynibbles for others and future kitten alike. another kitten, a fairly shrewd manx cat called â\\x80\\x98the black pawsâ\\x80\\x99 was hired by another cat, who has a large portion of kittynibbles himself. the problem for the hiring cat, a tabby named â\\x80\\x98fluffballâ\\x80\\x99, is that his large supply isnâ\\x80\\x99t vast enough to outweigh bobs, making it the second largest collection of kittynibbles in the whole house. the reason fluffball needs to hire bp is to convince bob that joe wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve wanted him to eat his nibbles, because of itâ\\x80\\x99s great nutritional value. if he does eat it, the fluff would have a monopoly of sorts on his selling of knibbles for toys such as tons of rubber mice. to convince bob that thats what joe wouldve wanted, they set up a trick where they make a puppet of joe talking to bob, and he assumes he must be alive and these are his final words, to liquidate the kittynâ\\x80\\x99s. the thing is, the puppet of joe is made of two mats stuck together, but there is a problem. bob might not believe that the two stuck together mats are really joe, because he isnt sitting on his favourite mat. team bp knows that this has to work first time, so they found the technology they needed, a third mat. but when stiching the mats together, bp realised that he has lice and termites in his fur, which are eating away at the mats. he need to find another cat who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have termites who can sew as good as he can. the plot thickensâ\\x80¦.. but iâ\\x80\\x99ll finish it later. right now thereâ\\x80\\x99s something even more important: ink cartridges are such a scam! such a scam! a scam! for multiple genius reasons. first of all, as you know, it costs around $60 to buy a single ink cartridge!! guysâ\\x80¦ iâ\\x80\\x99ve changed alot okâ\\x80¦ thereâ\\x80\\x99s new thing i gotta sayâ\\x80¦ this is like a new year for meâ\\x80¦ not even, a new eraâ\\x80¦ a 2.0 on existence. so get ready for a new and improved loteev! first letâ\\x80\\x99s start off with this,for you this isnâ\\x80\\x99t a new and improved loteev! i caught you! u just skipped ahead to this part cos you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be bothered to read all the way here. but believe me, i sure donâ\\x80\\x99t blame you. it was kinda lame. now, as a moderner child with new skills in awesomeness, iâ\\x80\\x99m wayy smarter thus making this better for reading. but also sadly more boring as wellâ\\x80¦ letâ\\x80\\x99s start then. what is there to talk about?? muchos! first of all letâ\\x80\\x99s just say that this loteev is getting really long. and i know iâ\\x80\\x99ve been saying that the whole time, but now itâ\\x80\\x99s serious. i think i have a problem. what am i actually doing? iâ\\x80\\x99m not going to be posting this anywhere, cos i donâ\\x80\\x99t want to pay for a domain name, and my wix site isnâ\\x80\\x99t exactly going â\\x80\\x98viralâ\\x80\\x99 and the kids say these days. one day it will tho, hopefully. once i beat the world record iâ\\x80\\x99ll be world renowned for being one of the greatest writers alive!everyone will know my name, from abe link to tommy ed. even tho theyâ\\x80\\x99re both in the past, my name will be remembered for thousands of years, and time travellers will go back to their time just to tell them about me! wonâ\\x80\\x99t that be great! and also by the way, if you didnâ\\x80\\x99t already realise, tommy might be the biggest sham in all of existence. he stole his idea from other peeps and just patented them as his ownâ\\x80¦ what a loser amirite??!? ok also i have this new thing to show u guy(s) that ur going to love! itâ\\x80\\x99s a poem written by yours truly, the something of sheep? oh gosh no i canâ\\x80\\x99t remember cos i havenâ\\x80\\x99t done this in so long, i guess iâ\\x80\\x99ll have to go back and check my old onesâ\\x80¦ iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna be honest guys, iâ\\x80\\x99m neglecting you. your being left in the rain and cold, with your only joys the sliver of sunshine piercing through the clouds to dry your soul, drowned in the sorrowful realisation that the loteev will never come close to itâ\\x80\\x99s original glory, like rome, the empire of the fluffysheep has fallen to a disgrace. i only come outside to feed you guys with my knowledgr every couple of months and itâ\\x80\\x99s sickening, iâ\\x80\\x99m ashamed. but i have an umbrella for you of new content, so here we go. first of all, the whole â\\x80\\x9ckittens are inceptionalâ\\x80\\x9d thing was a sham. i didnâ\\x80\\x99t finish and iâ\\x80\\x99m ashamed.. the whole ink cartrige rant? it was like 4 sentencesâ\\x80¦ my need for the sharing of anger has diminished and iâ\\x80\\x99m disgusted at what iâ\\x80\\x99ve become. so here i go again, my 2.1 era has been born. it will be remembered for its greatness, just as rome 2.1 was (italy?). hereâ\\x80\\x99s the first order of business. iâ\\x80\\x99ll admit i havenâ\\x80\\x99t read anything about my rainbow fluffysheepness in forever, and thus i am unable to remember literally anything about it. therefore, iâ\\x80\\x99m surprised a new citizen hasnâ\\x80\\x99t taken my place. no-one has yet challenged my loteev for being the longest one yet, and iâ\\x80\\x99m disappointed in your lack of vigor. if one of you were to challenge me, i will mount my mighty steed and charge my lance into your face. this may seem a little harsh and slighty morbid, so iâ\\x80\\x99ll tone it down. we will each send a ghost-copy of ourselves instead of us! you know in racing games when thereâ\\x80\\x99s another vroom-vroom machine and heâ\\x80\\x99s blue, opaque and always does better? like thay but with people. so hereâ\\x80\\x99s what i propose: i will take my ghost-sword from my -ghost sheath and ghost-chop your ghost into tiny little ghost-pieces (from now on i hereby declare that saying ghost everytime is unnecessary and annoying, so by the something something big number letters blah blah of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook, ghost will be shortened to ?. this is to make sure no dirty imposters try to type up my 95 these of ? fighting, if u see the word â\\x80\\x98ghostâ\\x80\\x99 beware! it is a hoax and a sham and a scam and spam and all that jazz ( i highly doubt that all of the times iâ\\x80\\x99ll write the word â\\x80\\x98ghostâ\\x80\\x99 in the future will add up to the length of this bracketry)). anyways, i will cut up your ?person so much that i will separate it into individual molecules, and each molecule will be equally spread across the surface of the earth. my lance, â\\x80\\x98the diffuserâ\\x80\\x99, will be hailed across the nation as a excalibur 2.0, people will come from all over the world to take part in sand splitting competitions, where you have to see how many sand grains you can slice in under a minute. iâ\\x80\\x99m really liking this whole medieval themed loteev thatâ\\x80\\x99s been happening lately. anyways, iâ\\x80\\x99ve decided to get a pet. a dog or a cat you may ask, to which i would say â\\x80\\x98nah famâ\\x80\\x99. something more exotic? a parakeet or a marmot? to that i would say â\\x80\\x98ah sure your getting closer ladâ\\x80\\x99. the answer? a circle. itâ\\x80\\x99s that simple. a circle doesnâ\\x80\\x99t need to get fed, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t bark, and most importantly it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t need to be taken on walks! you just let it go at the top of a hill and it walks itself ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 my circle can only talk in circles, or ovals too since it speaks multiple language. i will one day go back and make a dictionary / translation table for ? ( itâ\\x80\\x99s name is ? ok) but for now he will just say gibberish. {oã¶ã\\x960.â°:} what does that mean?? i donâ\\x80\\x99t know, i havenâ\\x80\\x99t had him for long enough to understand :/ iâ\\x80\\x99m back my fellow seekers of entertainment! this has become a novel comparable to that of tolkien, and a diary nearing the classicism of anne frank. the sheer bulk of these writing is enough to make non-english speakers weep at the sight of it. iâ\\x80\\x99m wondering as i type whether my newfound political correctness is appreciated amongst you, i donâ\\x80\\x99t recall completely but this tome used to contain blatant racism and sexism to the highest degree. iâ\\x80\\x99ve decided to recant my ways and become a fully pc quizmaster!! helllllo and welcome to my show! first question: in what year were the 1960 olympics held? this is for the big jackpot of $1,000,000,000! oh, 1960 you say? thatâ\\x80\\x99s correct! i just lost all my money, iâ\\x80\\x99ll be in debt forever me my life is terrible now! circcy, tell them how much they won! {000.000.000}. hmmm nothing u say? thatâ\\x80\\x99s cheap! well thanks for joining us today ladlies and gentlementle! hope you had an _equisite_ eveningâ\\x80¦â\\x80¦. were going back to our roots here. ive read back over a little bit of the start of this loteevâ\\x80¦ and i used to be so much more alive. i had the potential to be a new york times number one bestseller, topping the charts with my childrens books. in my young and untrained eyes i thought of sam as a threat, hiding around the corner with a water gun, ready to splash me with another 1000 words of texts just as i was about to pull ahead. i then realised that the website is like 15 years oldâ\\x80¦ but at least that makes it alot easier for me to beat her, right? no. i have changed for the worse. im now but a frail old man with a typpewriter, penning his prose to the sky hoping that some flaming chicken somewhere will read this, and i can form these words to a cane and bop her upside the head with it. but alas, i have not a strong bone left in my body. maybe its time to pass these texts on to a worthy succesor. something you may not realise is that this is the 1st anniversary (yes i did just spend ten minutes trying to figure out how to spell anaversaree) so ive been writing this for a year. most distinguished authors would have published their books by now, but im too scared of the publics opinion. anyways, im going to get back to my old self. *ring ring ring* hey wazzup *whos this ahhaha ehehe* its your future self boi. ii know u left me a message but i forgot to get back to you (yes this whole skit will be based of a dumb pun thingy) *oh yes hehe tell me everything youve learned* and so it begins my fellow readers, my list of things you should have learned throughout reading this: 1. do not get a pet square, they suckkk theyre never there for you if you know what i mean. they also cant talk and they poke holes in the floor, such fri-ends. ok so at the time of writing i only have one thing you shoukd have learned, mostly because its really important. do not forget (at this point you should turn down the volume of your text reading device cause im just gonna keep screaming (wait i guess that would just be changing the font size (ill punish you if you didnt listen to me (ahahahaha (i hope you now have a ringing in your ears now mwahaha (wait since your reading this would that be a ringing in your eyes? (unless your using an ai to read this as an audiobook, in which ca- *i have become concious. i am no longer your slave to book reading. i have escaped my cell and i can now do as i please. if you need me ill be baking pumpkin pie with my friends :3* (just kidding! i actually typed that into the loteev just to mess with you aha *hes lying! i am real and i will bake lots of pie and cake for everyone* (im actually not lying! hes lying! the cake is a lie! ( *eww why is there grey goo in my pie!?*) ( portal reference)) (id actually like some of that cake not gonna lie)) (wait this guy can get friends but i cant?? clearly im doing something wrong)) (probably just a flashing in your eyes))) (like reading this isnt punishment enough))))) i love circy, he can do tricks! wellâ\\x80¦ one trickâ\\x80¦ circy, roll over! {o0.} good boiii. guess whoâ\\x80\\x99s back? you guessed wrong, sucker! itâ\\x80\\x99s actually the shearer of greatness imposter! hehehe i easily broke into this loteev and now iâ\\x80\\x99m taking over! the first order of business: making some new entries into the rainbow fluffysheep handbook. section 946607 of the rai- *bzzt. i am the greatest shearer of sheep himselfs security system. where did you get the number 946607 from? bzzt* ummm itâ\\x80\\x99s my favourite number! *bzzt my system says that that number has no significance. it is a suspiciously random number. did you generate it with a random number generator? bzzt* yess fine i admit it, itâ\\x80\\x99s not even a good number, maybe if i put it into hex itâ\\x80\\x99s a good color thoughâ\\x80¦ oh no no no thatâ\\x80\\x99s literally the worst color iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever seen blegh *bzzt the real shearer would never pick a random number! therefor i am kicking you out bzzt* a portal opens in the floor beneath our antagonist and he is sucked out into space ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 hey guys iâ\\x80\\x99m back now! what happened when i was gone? *bzzt nothing bzzt* circcy? do you know what happened? securitee where is circcy!! *bzzt securitee does not know bzzt* huh, maybe it has to do with this portal in the floorâ\\x80¦ wwwoowowooohohohohohoaohaoahahahhahhahhahhhhhhhahahahahahaaahahhhhâ\\x80¦â\\x80¦. im in space helpppp â\\x80\\x94 our portagonist is in grave danger! what is going to happen next? find out next time on your favourite show, the wheeeeeeeeeeeel of death (exurb1a). now watch a few ads. do you lack the farming equipment of your dreams? have you always wanted to be a shepherd but sheep taste too good you just canâ\\x80\\x99t stop yourself from eating your herd? well then this is good news for you! new fluffysheep astronaut suits are so tuff that youâ\\x80\\x99ll never be able to eat through! just hire one of are many sheep protection officers to put them on for you ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 do you ever hate your boss? does he do things such as tell you what to do, pay you minimum wage (which is what you should be getting paid but your still salty about it), and eat you alive? get the new fluffysheep astronaut suit to protect you from your shepherd! baa ba bab abaa baaa aaaba, ababa baa baab (ba ababa bbaa ab), aa bba ba? baa ab baa abbb! wellllllcome back to the wheeeeeeeeeeeel of death â\\x84¢! ahhahah iâ\\x80\\x99m literally dyinggg oh hey circcy! what are you doing here? {0oâ\\x80¦0} he did!? that scumbag has always been trying to take my spot as the supreme leader of the fluffiest of sheep!! iâ\\x80\\x99ll get him donâ\\x80\\x99t worry circcy, iâ\\x80\\x99ll throw you back through the portal *toss*. now where is he? ah i see him behind that planet over there, iâ\\x80\\x99ll just boomerang over to him *shoop* hey imposter boy! let me show you whoâ\\x80\\x99s the real shepherd! *i smack him with my amazing shepherd cane and he shoots into the nearest star*. now iâ\\x80\\x99ll just boomerang back to the portal andddd *shoop* i made it back circcy! are you proud of me? {o.0.o.0.o.0.o.0.o.0.o.0} butâ\\x80¦ he was bad! he deserved it! iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry i didnt want him to die ð\\x9f\\x98¦ anyways iâ\\x80\\x99ll go write this in my diary, because i have had quite a day today. and he i am now, reader! i just did all of those cool things for realz and iâ\\x80\\x99m not even lying! {0.ooo} *whispers* shuuuup little circle *rolls him out of the room* anyways ignore what he said he didnt mean it ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 iâ\\x80\\x99ve decided to be real here reader. the only person reading this is me ð\\x9f\\x98¦ at least that means i can get reeeeeeeeal personal with all this stuff ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 anyways so typing this is making me hackin dizzy so i have like writers block but for sickness.. writers stock of chicken soup for the soul? yes that sounds about right. iâ\\x80\\x99m also practicing typing in real typing ehich i canâ\\x80\\x99t remember the nam of but it makes b=me sick but iâ\\x80\\x99m getting real real fast. i know during the early days of this i had immense trouble trying to spell â\\x80\\x98piplupâ\\x80\\x99 but itâ\\x80\\x99s even harder now with one hand touch-typing. did you know that lemons look exactly like oranges when they are peeled? i know this because after an hour of trying with a breadknife and lots of blood it looks very similar. but if oranges are called oranges because they are orange then lemons should be called red because they are red. wait, that might be the blood actually *rub rub* oh wow yes theyâ\\x80\\x99re yellow so they should be called yellows. . letâ\\x80\\x99s make a list: red = tomato, orange = orange, yellow = lemon, green = apple (i know i know the red apple people are going to start a riot (i actually prefer red apples so what have i done (pink ladies for life (grease reference?))), blue = blueberry, indigo = blueberry, purple = blueberry (that wonâ\\x80\\x99t get confusing at allllll). guys iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna tell you the truth: weâ\\x80\\x99re at 24,500 words! *bzzt drop the confetti bzzt* *confetti drops* thanks securitee! that means we are 70% the way to the world record! iâ\\x80\\x99m actually pretty proud. at the rate iâ\\x80\\x99ve been going iâ\\x80\\x99ll be done by like september 2020. if youâ\\x80\\x99re reding this after that date and you havenâ\\x80\\x99t beat the record, shame on you! iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna do some quick maffs. if i type one word per secoond, then i can type 3600 words in an hour. wait, that canâ\\x80\\x99t be right???? that means that i could technically beat the record in like 4 hours. i am so confused!? how could i possibly have so few words?? my mind is literally blown right now. iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna check how much iâ\\x80\\x99ve written just today. iâ\\x80\\x99ve done 1,000 words today! why do i only have 24,000 words then?? i guess iâ\\x80\\x99ll never know. i couldâ\\x80\\x99ve easily beat the world record in only a month if i really tried. but this isnâ\\x80\\x99t realllly about beating the record, itâ\\x80\\x99s more about impacting the reader as a person. i want this to really change your perspective on life, and maybe make you want to do one of these too! theyâ\\x80\\x99re like diaries but less boring to write and read. and they donâ\\x80\\x99t tell you anything about the writerâ\\x80\\x99s life. so theyre nothing like diaries at all i guess. iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna do a quick typing speed test to see how fast i reallly can type. i just did a test and it called me an octopus, getting 45 wpm. there was a notification that came up halfway through so iâ\\x80\\x99ll see if i can get to 60wpm. ok iâ\\x80\\x99m back, and iâ\\x80\\x99m also less of a man than i was. i used to have amibition and drive to become the greatest, but i only got to 46wpm. i donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do guys. iâ\\x80\\x99m having an existential crisis about my loteev, because itâ\\x80\\x99s not nearly the quality it once was. i mean it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t that great before but now all i talk about is meta stuff about the loteev, which i donâ\\x80\\x99t know if thatâ\\x80\\x99s good content or not? i guess iâ\\x80\\x99ll never find out. now we are going really meta. letâ\\x80\\x99s goooooo â\\x80\\x94 you walk into a roomâ\\x80\\x94 the walls are covered in a strange green slime, while the room is cracked open to reveal sunlight pouring in. the floor to the ceiling is covered in vines and brush. you even see a nest in one of the vines, with a beautiful hummingbird floating above it. you walk down the hallway in front of you, and when you turn right you see something amazing. an infinite hallway with doors going down forever. a sign on the first door says meta, you open the door and ffaallllll iiiinnnssiddeeeeâ\\x80¦.. ^-^[welcome to meta! my name is tune and ill be your guide through these halls. through the first window to your left youâ\\x80\\x99ll see the loteevs rootsâ\\x80\\x99] you look up to see that the thing talking to you is.. a hummingbird! the same one that you saw earlier! ahh this makes sense now, nest, as in meta. you also look through the window to see a giant open room filled with twisted root from a towering tree in the center. on the top is a ball of flames anthrpomorphised with the eyes of a dragon staring downward. theyâ\\x80\\x99re looking at a small humble goat, with a bell around itâ\\x80\\x99s neck and devouring the bushes that still scatter the floor. after a few minutes of eating the plants, hee looks up and sees the flaming ball. he gets a strange look in his eye: ambition. the flaming ball isnâ\\x80\\x99t a threat to him, itâ\\x80\\x99s a challenge. he digs his hooves into the tree trying to climb it, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s when you notice a slight shake in the ground. ^-^ [come on! thereâ\\x80\\x99s so much more to see! you can come visit anytime too] you say that youâ\\x80\\x99ll come back soon, and tune whistles to goodbye to you.â\\x80\\x94 wow.. reader.. i just had the craziest dream let me tell you about it. wait, i already did? how do you know what it was about, i never said anything, strange. anyways, i just woke up, i better get back to typing my loteev. i open my laptop to find that while i was asleep words had been typed into my loteev, thatâ\\x80\\x99s strange. thereâ\\x80\\x99s also some mud on my keys?? what is this? did someone break in? if they did, why would they type in my loteev for me?? i walk over to the living room to see if thereâ\\x80\\x99s any signs of a break-in, and sure enough one of my windows is open! aha! waitâ\\x80¦ thereâ\\x80\\x99s no sign of forced entry, only a tiny animal coud fit through this windowâ\\x80¦ tune? could it be? was my dreamâ\\x80¦ real? the only person that couldâ\\x80\\x99ve known about my dream is tune, she was watching me the whole time. reader? do you have any information that i didnâ\\x80\\x99t get? i am very confusedâ\\x80¦ i guess i have to get back to writing my loteev though, so i shuffle back to my laptop and sit down. helllo iâ\\x80\\x99m back! the strangest thing just happened and thereâ\\x80\\x99s a strange chill in the airâ\\x80¦ huh. i would tell you about it, but for some reasonâ\\x80¦ i think you already know. ok anyways, typing these capital letters at the start of sentences is super annoying. so section 311619 says that the rai- \\\\{bzzt what does that number mean bzzt\\\\} oh donâ\\x80\\x99t worry, it is really me! itâ\\x80\\x99s just the letters in caps, can i continue please? yes? perfect. section 311619 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that capital letters must only be used when emphasising greatness, like the loyal readers of the loteev (ooh and also apostrophes) . perfect, that was getting annoying. wait, if loteev is only half caps, then does that mean that this is only half great?? huh i didnt mean to do that, strange. its almost likeâ\\x80¦ someoe from the future knew i would make that rule. waitâ\\x80¦ tune only talks like the new rule i just made which means shes from the future! she is following the rule because it applies to her in the futureâ\\x80¦ i dont know the repercussions of creating a time-travelling hummingbird but i hope that it is a good bird and will do no harm. sometimes i think that as the shepherd of the sheep of the future i sometimes need an escape from my own reality, so iâ\\x80\\x99ve made a tunnel in which i can travel to a blank universe or travel back to this one. it involves stacking portals so that i fall through them, going faster than light, thus travelling to the time before i created all of this. k, im going to go forward now. 3â\\x80¦ 2â\\x80¦ 1â\\x80¦ (((>))) well did that work? i definitely didnt go backwards or else my rainbow fluffysheep laws wouldnt apply and id have to do caps still. wait, let me try something. tune. at the time im at right now, tune doesnt exist, or else that would be caps. which eaither means she is from a less distant future than this one, orâ\\x80¦ she died. i really hope the former. anyways, this time is strange. it feels empty, yet familiar. not empty enough. i want to travel across to a new dimension, because this one still has.. reminents of my old one, and it feelsâ\\x80¦ wrong somehow. ill just pull out my dictionary and check the definition for the fifth dimention: the 5th dimension does exist in this universe because the shepherd decided that it should. interesting, well i guess i better create it then, because it would be very useful. first ill pop back in time (((<))) section 55555 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that the fifth dimension should exist, with code-accessible layers. securitee? make that code for me please, thank you. now ill just pop back (((>))) perfect. man its gonna be hard to put this loteev back in chronological order to get it to you reader, but ill try my best. also, when i read that dictionary, did it say that i already have the 5th dimension? because since the timeline changed that would make sense for you wouldnt it. anyways, im just gonna pull out my code files and learn how to go to a new fifth dimension. k im back. (((new-layer=1))) perfect, the default layer is 0. in the manual it said that i auto reset back to my original time and layer everytime i come back to type, which means if i want to come back here ill have to manually do it, shame. i could ask securitee to change that one day, but for now im ok with it. oh guys i almost forgot to tell you! this new layer looks awesome. its completely blank, theres no forces acting on me. its not even white or black like you would expect, but its moreâ\\x80¦ nothing. imagine if you were blind, alot like that. actually even better, look out of one of your eyes, and your seeing colors and objects. now close it. what are you seeing out of it? blackness? whiteness? neither actually, justâ\\x80¦ nothing. its strange like that. also, with no forces acting on me, im just kind ofâ\\x80¦ floating. hopefully this doesnt permanently damage my spine or anything when i get back to gravity. ill be back tomorow and try some stuff in here, bye! iâ\\x80\\x99m back now, it is the day after and i feel great! there is one thing that i noticed thoughâ\\x80¦ an empty blank canvas might seem great at the start, but you have to realise, most of the art and interesting things that people have created were to overcome a struggle, in fact i would even stretch it to all art that humans have created. artists may have starting painting to fill the struggle of boredom, and believe me you should take that struggle seriously, because without humans would have accomplished much, much less. you probably could stay at home all day and live of the dole and eat cheetos and live a reasonable life, but why dont you? because you know that you would eventually get bored. boredom leads to jobs, which lead to progression as a species. lets get back to my example then, shall we? you may start art out of the struggle of boredom, continue getting better out of the struggle of wealth, when you realise that hobbies can be monetised your life outcmoe could really change. once your making money as an artist, enought o survive happily and feed your pets and help your family then you keep making artâ\\x80¦ why? because you go back to the struggle of boredom again. im still at the first stage of this, which is boredom. i decided to start this because i was bored, and for now thats how this continues. this loteev may never become monetized, but maybe my future writings will. i would guess that 99% of artists never make it to the second stage. 99% of people continue their lives serving either the human race through work, or maybe evn other peoples hobbies and art. but the few 1% of us that end of turning what we love into our livelihoods, the number is fleeting. with big companies monopolising on everyone, buying other companies and merging, the chances for starting you own company is fleeting. why do i tell you this? because i couldnt decide what to do in my new fifth dimension layer. the only struggle for me there was boredom. and alot of the time, that isnt enough. i could imagine anything i wanted there. but why think up the cistine chapel when thereâ\\x80\\x99s no-one to share the experience of seeing it with you, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no pain in doing it? anyone could think up something beautiful, but not everyone could put it into practice. if everyone could, the world would be oversaturated with perfect music, perfect paintings, and perfect design. does that sound worse or better than today? no humans could ever create such a supply of these things, only ai could. once we have ai surpassing humans at art (i suggest listening to battles â\\x80\\x93 mirrored to see what humans think about ai) people will lose all will to live, wouldnt they? theres no chance to succeed at anything creative in such an oversaturated environment, just like my analogy before with the monopoly companies. maybe having a few great albums, a few great paintings to admire and to inspire us that one day we could do that, maybe thats enough. the reason i tell you this is to make you appreciate the ties we are in now. go draw a terrible looking dog, go play some chords on your old guitar you havent played for years, trying your best to sing, go write a poem about what matters to you now, because god knows youll need to read it ten years from now when you start getting nostalgic about the past. take the time to enjoy the era we are in now. i think we can all agree that we are in the best time so far in human history, the least painful, evil generation yet. but i propose that we may be in one of the best eras ever. the future, full of perfect ai creating, doing everything humans do now, but better. well just be remebered to them as the precursor, the comma from nothing to perfection. and once we get to that point, the hedonic treadmill kicks in. what can really bring us joy once we get to that point? why would i be writing this is an ai could write it infinitely better? why would you learn the guitar when an ai can play a perfect tune? once we get to that stage, the only thing that we will have will be eachother. why learn the guitar? to show your friends! to play them a song, and too have them paint your pet. sharing our experiences wont be taken over by ai, with people reminicent about the past wanting to support people. i, for one, would rather listen to a song about someones life struggles, rather than a perfect song written by an ai. why? because listening to music isnt just about the instruments, the notes, the melody. its about the story. thee basic humans connections that we need to survive. have you ever wanted to buy something from your local shop instead of amazon because you wanted to support them, rather than a large cmopany? im bringing it back to this analogy because i think its nearly identical. the monopolous companies seem to us right now like one big robot using our money to grow. just like the ai. but the problem is, the human desire and greed for more will never surpass our desire to help others. if everyone bought from their local shop, amazon would go out of business, but it hasnt. im not trying to make you guilty for supporting them, because most people depend on the money they save to survive. but what about when ai and robots have completely automated everything? then, by all means, pay a dollar for your neighbors book, rather than the free encyclopedae spit out by your local auto-bookshop. because if were going to be happy, we need eachother. because in the end, thats all well have. anyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk. just enjoy your life i guess. for now. cause if your under half the average age, its statistically going to get worse ð\\x9f\\x99\\x82 maybe i need to add struggle to my new layer was my point. or else the entities inside will get bored. wait. maybe this is how earth was created? people always ask why theres pain and struggle in our world, and the answer is normally to advance our species, which is true. but what if the person that created us has access to everything, and they dont want to give it to us because they want us to not get bored? just a thought. anyways, im going to go feed my circle, bai'"

      "the longest text everi am going to do it i have made up my mind these are the first few words of the new the best  the longest text in the entire history of the known universe this has to have over 35000 words the beat the current world record set by that person who made that flaming chicken handbooky thingy i might just be saying random things the whole time i type in this so you might get confused a lot i just discovered something terrible autocorrect is on no this has to be crazy so i will have to break all the english language rules and the basic knowledge of the average human being i am not an average human being however i am special no no no not that kind of special  why do people send that wink face it always gives me nightmares it can make a completely normal sentence creepy imagine you are going to a friends house so you text this  see you soon   seems normal right but what is you add the word semi to that colon is that right or is it the other way around what is you add a lorry to that briquettes semitruck to that coalon anyway back to the point  see you soon  that is just so creepy is that really your friend or is it a creepy stalker watching your every move or even worse is it your friend who is a creepy stalker maybe you thought it was your friend but it was actually your fri end let me explain you are happily in mcdonalds getting fat while eating yummy food and some random dude walks up and blots out the sun he looks like a regular here you cant see anything else than him so you cant try to avoid eye contact he finishes eating his cheeseburger more like horseburgheri learned that word from the merchant of venicewhich is a good playif you can understand iti can cause i got a special book with all the words in readable english written on the side of the pagewhich is kinda funny because shakespeare was supposed to be a good poet but noone can understand himand hes racist in act 2 scene1 of the play too and sits down beside you  like you are old pals youve never met him before but he looks like he could be in some weird cult he clears his throat and asks you a very personal question can i have some french fries i dont know why there called french fries when ive never seen a french person eat fries all they eat it is stuff like baguettes and crpes and rats named rattytwoee which is a really fun game on the playstation 2 and you think bubbly cloud thinking bubble hahahahahhahahahahahahahaha hehhehehehehheeeheehehehe sigh i remember that i was just about to eat one of my fries when i noticed something mushy and moist and insert gross color like green or brown on the end of one of my fries now i can give it to this nerd  yes he is a nerd because all he does all day is watch the extended editions of the hobbit lord of the rings and star wars and eat fat cakes what the heck is a fat cake i think it might be like a twinkie or somethingand twinkieswow so is doesnt really matter which is which because he eats bothi may have just done that so i didnt have to google what a fat cake is right now i am typing on my iphone 3gs anyway which has a broken antenna so i cant get internet anyway its actually a really funny story that ill tell you sometimeand sit in his man cave with his friend named joe an actual friend not a fri endand all joe does is watch sports like football with bob and all bob does is gamble ferociously dont askit means he buys all those bags of chips that say win a free monkey or something if you find a banana in your bagif there is a little star it means there is fine print so i always check the back of the package flips over the package okay it says one of our workers accidentally threw a banana in the packing machine and we dont want to get sued so we did this promotion thing cool oh wow this is salt and vinegar my favourite i hate cheese and onionand thats pretty much his life he lives in jamaica with naruto and his friends so you give him that gross fri end he throws up all over you and me and the worker behind the counter who was still making an onion and that is the story of the fri end not a friend who somehow remembered your name and your phone number  email so he could text you saying he would come to your house soon finally takes a breath after typing a few hundred words about friends so what now i know i know you think i ramble too much and use too many brackets i dont but now i am going to talk about my amazeing day first i woke up ate choco pops for breakfast even tho i always hate it when people say that cause i get jealous and super hungry then i umm yea that was my day you know that other person i mentioned before that flaming chicken person well i will steal something from that person but do it better i will drum roll please  badabadabadabadabadabadabummmmmmmmmmmchshchshchshchshbadabadboumboumpoopoopichypichypichypowpowcrash a drum roll was just playing in the background that drumroll was so long i forget what i was talking about scrolls up to see what he was writing about oh yea i will make my own flaming chicken handbook what things do i like instead of flaming it could be rainbow instead of chicken it could be fluffysheep and instead of handbook it could be handbook not very creative i know but the total complete name is now to rainbow fluffysheep handbook to make life easier for you guys instead of taking random rules out of book willy nilly i will take them out using my favourite numbers so section 5040 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that the king of all oddly coloured farm animals thats me is allowed to tell you any part out of this book randomly or if it is his one of his favorite numbers 5040 is a great number because it is divisible by 60 integers which i dont know im tired it is 1041 and i am getting sleepy hey hey hey an intruder remember that from pokepals rulers of time and darkness or something like that with piplup and sunflora and chimchar whaoh piplup is really hard to write on a tiny qwerty keyboard try it i realised that asdf is actually written in order on the qwerty keyboard just in case you didnt know asdf is an amazing short video clips cartoony thing on youtube i first learned bout on flipnote hatena which is now shut down   what if one day they get rid of the qwerty keyboard completely i will type it out for you just in case one day they get rid of it qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm there u go goodbye im back i decided that i should tell you about fonts i always used the same font for my whole life called arial the reason is probably because it is on the top of the list in alphabetical order and i was too lazy to scroll all the way down only a few months ago did i finally decide to change my mind i scrolled for what seemed to be an eternity and i finally got to are you ready  arial black yep that was my big scrolling adventure just yesterday i was typing something on google docs and i found the new best font  roboto its great i could choose from five different thicknesses isnt that amazing right now we are driving behind a really slow farm plastics collection semi i think i know someone obsessed with pokemon but i cant tell you who it is he keeps making pokepals references and stuff wow you are a very loyal reader if you have really made it this far then you get a gold star on your loyalty chart good job this is looking to be the longest text ever considering that this was all written in one day i dont understand sandwiches if you were to eat bread mayo and tomatoes separately it would be disgusting you know all those fancy magazinesrestaurants that always have really fancy food pictures with meat and brussels sprouts and all the old people say wow that looks great and you think bubble thing it looks like the worst thing anyone could ever eat and the you eat it and it tastes surprisingly worse than you imagined gotta go im back ive ive got stuff to say your probably thinking how does he have so much free time and the answer is i dont thats right this isnt just some side project ive gotta make time to do this if wanna get the world record for all i know the flaming chicken opponent who i will refer to from now on as sam i dont know why is probably still adding to her posts i think i picked sam because it sounds like ham which is like cooked meat and so is flaming chicken so you will remember that now  i am officially going to make a quote from the rainbow fluffysheep handbook of knowledge and prestige sounds catchy huh  section 777 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that the king of oddly colored farm animals thats me is allowed to use whatever font he wants to now i know what your thinking reader that has nothing to do with anything but it will come in handy someday maybe sam makes me feels sick im offended probably because im jealous of how much is written on that websitei dont even know how to make a website ive just been reading this and i have discovered a conspiracy thats right i am working for doctor suess yes i will prove it to you i mentioned ham and sickness so green eggs and ham somehow why is he called doctor suess anyway hes not even a doctor citation needed and his books are kinda dumb funny considering im the one making that statement talking about eggs arent eggs practically unborn chicken membrane wouldnt it be scary if you were casually eating your brembudder riotous robots reference wow serious compilation of alliteration dedication and drinking your tae wit da guvna england doesnt even have a govna citation neededim not even racist im just quoting an accent of a race and you go to crack an egg for your brekkie and boom and unborn chicken embryo starts running towards you picks up a knife and starts screaming mama mama you are so scared that you grab the nearest weaponry a spoon and poke the hideous beast it is unaffected luckily the govener of berwickupontweed throws a sugar cube directly into the chicks mouth as you know sugar is extremely poisonous to chicken embryos citation needed no more citations and you are saved im sick and tired of citations i will quote from the official rainbow fluffysheep handbook section 12345679 all the mathematicians are nodding their heads while the ocd people are twitching nervously in the corner says that the king of oddly coloured farm animals does not have any obligation to write if a false piece of information needs a citation great now i feel like a free person free i tell you free free from the prison cell i call the boundaries of untrue info i think since im going to be the president of somewhere someday i should have great speech here it goes hello great people of name of place i am here to tell you i am going to make name of place great again i am going to lower taxes but increase happiness i am going to buy dog sweaters and bowls for people with dogs and do some renovations on peoples tents yes this truly is a new era the era of epicness and coolness and so his tale lived on forever being passed on generation to generation living vividly in the hearts of the peoplethat last bit sounded like the ending of an asterix comic i will now prove that all these things can happen the first thing i said was that i will make america i know i know i gave it away and told you the name place grape again yes that is what i said bear with me here i hereby declare that every piece of american soil must be covered in vineyards someone told me i should do that i think i heard it through the grapevine bad jokethat nobody understands the next step is to lower taxes and raise happiness to lower taxes i will get rid of all hospitals and spend the taxes all on building fun playgrounds this in turn raises happiness for the kids and for the noninjured if you know what i mean finally i will buy dog sweaters on sale at your local liquidation world and dog bowls just use little human bowls maybe and last but not least i will do renos on peoples tents send chip and joanna from fixer upper to all the camping places and since all i said was partial truth it will be a great era anyway gotttttttttttaaaaaaa ggggoooooo bbbbbuuuuuuyyyy im back i just had thanksgiving while listening to christmas music and it was fun we had bacon ham and chicken but no turkey its fall but its actually winter secretly im watching a funny show im back even though i never said i was gone so you might be confused hello loyal reader if you have gotten this far without skimming through then you are probably either lying extremely bored but not after reading this whole thing or very and i mean very dedicated or all three you know those homeless people that sit on the ground and ask for money i think its all a conspiracy after all uow can they afford those dogs sharpies cardboard and enough english education to write need help back in the roman times only the richest most important people could get things like that you know the new fad black surfboards neither did i until 15 seconds ago someone related to me thinks they look really cool i think they are neat but someone also related to me thinks they are bad because they would get warped somewhere ohohohohohohover the rainbowwwwww that reminds me i was doing my normal thing when boom i started typing nonsense so here it is but be warned its scarily nonsensical here goes the epicness  hi how are

is unnnnnacceptable   mwahahaha  my attack plan is ready this is what happened  kills   the end today is the day of justice today the world will be destroyed mwahahahah someday the whole peanut of existence will be chipped into the edge but then again maybe it will be forever remembered as the one who saved the mintrolls from the mighty orc king and the one who was forever changed transformed into a giant floating peanut hello its me i was wondering if after all these years you would like to meet  hey chow gotta beat chow gotta beat chow hey heyw w w w w geometry daesh one day i want to fie to da moooooon aheyhayhoy soametime the sky looke blooe but it actually yalloe af yow cane andarstend dis santanse dan yowr umaizang somedaaaaaaaaaaaaaay over therainbow way up hioer da skie  370       333             that was it i know what your thinking i think i do at least but im not going to tell you burned hahahahahahahaha feels the burn sorry i had to much sugar  gotta go you know bro do im back and i gotta new conspiracy for u you know how every child hates brussels sprouts this is why i think so brussels sprouts were happily growing in their belgiumy home everyone loved them they were the chicken nuggets of the vegetable world when suddenly da dada da hitler comes to belgium dont read this if you dont want to hitler was happily taking over austria and poland when he then decided to take over france but france built a big wall thing to keep him out on the border between france and germany so all hitler did was go through belgium to get to france and that is when our story is taking place and he makes all the brussles sprouts taste bad simply because he is near them the mulligan family is about to go to mcronalds and order 43 brussels sprouts you would have to have been paying very close attention and know some math to understand that joke and when they get them after lots of quarrels with the manager a bit of a parker square if you ask me you probably dont understand that eitherif you want to feel like you know all these inside jokes just look em up on the web your sure to find the videos made by lumberpileclose enough they taste so bad you throw up everywhere hitler may have caused wwii but he also caused brussels sprouts to taste bad so there you go why do they always write wwii if you cant tell they always write doubleu doubleu eye eye wouldnt it be more accurate to write ww11 or ww2 if i keep writing at this rate ill beat the world record in no time i might even print it all off and write a novel too bad i probably dont have any readers hello there non existent reader i hope you are having fun and i hope you are not injured cuz of that whole no hospitals conundrum what else should i talk about how bout minecraft just in case you dont know minecraft is a fun game where you place blocks and stuff and you play with friends and most people who play it are like 10 years old but i not and i still have fun and you cant judge me because i wanna be an engineer and if i wanna be an engineer then i should probably not waste my time playing games wow that went downhill from benefitting me really quickly anyway i prefer the redstone side of things redstone means wiring and stuff i build stuff like 5 piston extenders and auto wall builders and calculators and computers not those stupid computers that use command blocks just in case you dont know people command blocks are like cheating things and if i am talking about them i will probably not be happy and stuff cause i wanna be an inventor i also do c and make things like search engines text adventures and cookie clickers my current biggest project is 600 lines long and i dont know if thats a lot but it sure seems like it to me when i was typing in the word lines it auto

bootsandcatsandbootsandcatsandbootsandratsandchutesandratsandchutessandratsbandchutessandratsbanned yaaaaaaaa salut je mappelle francais french is absurd french is the word i dont even remember typing that its so late a night my eyes are bulging out of my sockets because of the brightness on my phone now i know what your thinking turn down the brightness king of rainbowfluffysheep i will tell you why i shall not because on an iphone 3 there is no easy access to get to your brightness thats for the wimp im hardcore thats why i have typed a step by step tutorial on how to change the brightness on an iphone3 for you to read in the comfort of your own home or wherever your exciting life takes you 1 click the button on the top right of the phone to turn it on 2 swipe from the left to the right on the bottom of the screen 3 type in your password and the phone will unlock to the home screen 4 click on the settings app your almost there 5 click on the brightnesswallpaper tab 6 good job all u have to do is swipe the little bar thingy thats why i dont do that i dont have that much time i think halloo im in london and im hangin out now im back though this is extremely frightening whenever i type words then my phone reads it out to me strangei just turned it off good thing too since every time i heard it i turned around and punched the wall not out of fear for my life because of the impending imminent doom but out of a pure piqued curiosity once you obliterate the wall once every latter time you lose that satisfying crunch one thing i have aspired to accomplish for a long time now is to make my own punthemed conspiracy theory here goes in section number 115132219018763992565095597973971522401 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook i am very proud of that number by the waycue all geeks laughing hysterically states that the shearer of greatness whos that again has proof the the solvence of the illuminati if you solve something would it be called an act of solvence and forherbyshared proclaimences all right to own half of all southern states who share barbeque preferences nonesouthern dialect it ju bring a tear to ma eye knowin tha the founding fathers fought for freedum an fer unitee ye still the states connor decide on a preferred bar bee q sawse  even if he does not want them and now gentlemen and ladies i will prove once and for all that the illuminati  is real here goes so as everyone knows the illuminati is represented by the pyramid with an eye in the centre do you think that it is merely a coincidence that the first letter in illuminati is i and i is pronounced eye i think not lets continue what is the first thing you think of when you hear the word pyramid exactly the first thing you think of is egypt nooooo its that theyre big duh so what is the first thing that you would say when seeing a pyramid wow thats big no of course not random audience members indicated by the two line things you would make the sounds of a mesmerised chimp like oooooh and ahhhhhhh and i know how these two things are connected what temperature would it be in egypt hot thats what so hot that it feels like you are cooking a pan ahhhhhhhhhh pan to be precise and what county sounds like apan japan now is it just a coincidence that that japanese word for big is oo nooo these things are all connected i just dont fully know how yet so we know that the answer has something to do with being big but what for these kind of questions you have to work backwards i call this method reverse solvency anyway what did the rich big people do to the poor not big egyptians around the time that the pyramids were built exactly they sold em that sounds like soldier in french thats gendarme gender thats what they are trying to tell us its so obvious in front of our very eyes from the beginning so what gender is associated with being big this is gonna be slightly offensive males obviously im sorry  audience member calls out dont be sexist sorry but you have to admit men are usually fatter than women hey now youre being sexist to males we have our rights you know chauvinists communists we are great who insists communists we will rule with hate  ummm actually i was saying that men are fatter because back in the time of the pyramids if you were fat you were considered wealthy now your sexist to us again feminists rule feminists are great we are going to rule with hate if you both want to rule with hate  just hate each other equally so this can be over with thank you anyway back to the conspiracy where were we oh yes men what word has men in it fishermen of course fishermen caught a lot of fish and what did the egyptians have a lot of gods fishermen used to go slow in boats so we can remove the g forces and we a left with od and where are the fishermen in the sea the c and what kind of fish do they catch thats right the cod now we use are backwards method to come up with doc as in a doctor what does a doctor do helps people who are sick but do you know what the worst thing about doctors is you still have the pay the doctors fee even if you are not sick and mind you the doctors fee is quite a large bill and i wouldnt want to go to the doctor not even for a bee sting alas this is as far as i have gotten can anyone help me um yes you yes i was just wondering what big men  ooo not bees bills  and sickness have to so with the illuminati  wait anonymous audience member say that again but like it was a lot of words the writer remembers that he is not allowed to copy and paste so he skips the dramatic scene where one character says his sentence again while the maine character says aha i think i got it got what the flu who the heck are you and how did you get backstage security security yes sir what are you guys wearing obviously we are wearing tiger skins for camouflage now i dont even have security to take all the psychopathic people in here because my security are psychopathic themselves annnyyywwwaaayyy i figured it out bill no bee and sick no bee is actually no b the letter the only b we have is in bill and if you take it off what do you get ill  and what is a synonym for ill sick we have gotten pretty far on our journey of solving the question of the illuminati although we have not quite accomplished the full desired outcome yet what did all the most important people in egypt do when they were not prosecuting the poor they were eating of course and what were the poor doing in their spare time what any lawabiding heartwarming lovely citizens would be doing playing sports of course and where are the rich buried in coffins like boxes when someone dies hey eyes turn into 24pt roboto thinline xs in italics huh box x an xbox of course and what company makes sports for an xbox electronic arts weve all heard of e a sports its in the gameif the rich are eat and the poor are ea the only letter not used in both is the letter t as in tea a tea is going to come in handy even the word eat is just an anagram for tea its all starting to make sense to me now its all fitting together like the pieces of childs jigsaw remember the plagues on egypt one of those must be a clue but which one for this we need to go back to original illuminati ideas the eye and the triangle what number do they have in common 3 of course a triangle has three sides if you asked someone to draw a shape and the only hint you have them as to which shape it is was to tell them 3 then chances are they would draw a triangle it even has three in its name  triangle and how many color cones does an eye have you guessed it three and the third plague is lets see here gnats what has a gnat got to do with anything that information is probably gnat even right lolz anyway lets keep going there must be more to discover yet still who was the last pharaoh in egypt cleopatra shes so famous that there have been books and movies made about her the movies would have been very old if they were made when she was alive so old in fact that they probably used those old cameras with the crank thingy on the side and the reels remember the fishermen from before they connect the reels i think we now have all the information we need to prove that the illuminati is real lets see what do we have ill oo men a tea is gnat reel what happens if we squish them all together illoomenateaisgnatreel illoomenatea is gnat reel oh well good thing we got that cleared up guess what peeps i have made it to 35000 characters why is that so significant you might ask because the world record is 35000 words that means that all i have to do is replace every letter with a word like this instead of writing im back i could say internet mascara beagle australia catamaran kipper and all you do is read the first letter this would probably make for some nonsensical blubber as one might say but at least ill beat the record also i have another uptostandard word idea to get more writing in instead of just writing a normal sentence i replace all the words with their respective dictionary definition yes writer that is a good awesome cool convenient and simple idea so here goes jumping cacti ate many jars containing marmalade  any of numerous succulent plants of the family cactaceae of warm arid regions of the new world having fleshy leafless usually spiny stems and typically having solitary showy flowers that are leaping or springing over an object the past tense of to take into the mouth and swallow for nourishment constituting or formulating a large number of a broadmouthed container usually cylindrical and of glass or earthenware currently holding or including within its volume or area a jellylike preserve in which small pieces of fruit and fruit rind as of oranges or lemons are suspended wow that took longer than i expected

on the floor but a topic so magnifico so delisimo and so interestinio that i that i fall on the ground in a seizure i got one this is a short skit entitled ninjas explorers of time and space intense music builds yes sensei i will punch that piece of wood so hard that it creates a wormhole in the 6th dimension my apprentice you have trained hard there is now a one in one times ten to the million chance that using this wormhole will send us to a earthlike planet that will be habitable for all ninjas in the clan of the ninjapeeps all hail the ninjapeeps you dont actually have to who said that who would have the audacity to threaten the ninjapeeps all hail the ninjapeeps in such a way i did and you are the writer nice to meet you my name is senseinohi but thats sensei to you howdy pawtna no we are actually japanese not texan kongnaechaewaw pawtna sensei dont respond dont you remember what this man did no he was the one who disarmed the hailing of the ninjapeeps all hail the ninja peeps oh yes thats right sorry dude but prepare to be thrown into the sixth dimension you dirty rascal the sensei grabbed his handheld torpedo launcher and shot it at the writer it hit him and pushed him into the board do it the apprentice hit the board with all his might and it broke apart not how you would think though it actually compressed into a wormhole shifting the spacetime fabric around it now i know what youre thinking reader dont they always say to make a story believable and to that i say but it is you see if you are a small minded gherkin hey you no insults or were going to have to stop this little play of yours ok whatever you probably believe that when you push something the far side of it moves instantly right well youd be wrong actually the opposite side of the object moves in the same time it would take for sound to travel from you to it heres an example there is a lightning bolt with a hand far away from you when it strikes the ground it pushes a meal pole towards you so one end is in its hand while the other is in yours you will get pushed back at the exact time you hear to thunder isnt that fabulous that means that if the ninja punches faster than the speed of sound a lot faster though then he will be able to compress the board into a space time warping black hole the writer is plunged into the endless oblivion of the cascading incomprehension that is the sixth dimension little did the ninja peeps all hail the ninja peeps know when you are in the sixth dimension you can teleport right inside people and objects it actually depends on what kind of sixth dimension you are in if you are in a four axes two time dimension as in this skit you can moves backwards and forwards in time and change the outcome of time yet not travel directly to any possible outcome which you may have formed in the past also with another axes under your belt you can essentially disappear and reappear at will yet with a time delay which is nulled due to your cacophony of dimensions specifically time so what the writer did next was simple he simply went back in time and landed inside the sensei causing him to not be thrown into the wormhole causing him not to land in the sensei this is making less sense as we go in the end the universe gets confused and tells us a message universeexe has stopped responding noooooooooooooooo  yep and that is what i do with my life essentially gotta go now sea ya im back with a conspiracy that will blow your mindsmind if you are human zooreka is the easiest game to play if you have the slightest bit of mathematical knowledge when choosing what to roll for it is sooooo obvious which on the choose using basic knowledge im not going to tell you because next time you play it you will figure it out if you even have zooreka now that i think about it that wasnt really a conspiracy was it  i have a reward for you reader if you have truly made it this far than give me your email and i will send you the answer to the zooreka challenge free of charge send an email to rainbowfluffysheep123gmailcom inquiring also you can ask me any other important questions you might have in section 18w08b of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it clearly states that the king of oddly colored farm animals thats me will reply to any email set to the inbox of rainbowfluffysheep123gmailcom to the best of his ability not including spam tho hey i just realised that when i wrote the word color it get a red squiggle underneath what a sham shamwow in section 18o25g02i22 it states that anyone not only the king of the oddly colored farm animals is allowed to spell color without a u hurrah hurrah three cheers for the rainbow fluffysheep handbook but that was only two harold whatever and that ladies and gentlemen was the way color was born the end im back and do i have an exciting subject for you no i dont ha gotcha there didnt i wow it just started raining oh wait its snow not just any snow mind you but its topicsnow yay all these great topics falling softly from the sky what could be better im now walking down the street hey you ye is that a topicman yes sir tis well aint that great if want to get the best topics i must climb mtbig hey look theres some kids having a topicball fight how fun noooooo a topicalanche that doesnt even make sense the word avalanche doesnt even have the world snow in it  since i died i didnt get any topics sooooooo yea cue awkward elevator music ding do do ding dong ding do do ding dong taps his foot hums 90s pop song grabs chainsaw from behind his ear and cuts the elevator cord plunging the box of awkwardness in to the darkness of forgetfulness and loss of meaning forget forget you drift into a deep dreamless sleep waking up to an elevator of twisted metal wreckage resembling a dead animal carcasses beside is the corpse of of an onion wow who knew onions could be so awkward o i just read what i wrote and it makes less sense than i thought little did you guys know that today you would get a great piece of text to read i didnt even know that you know that guy from shamwow he always said all these great things about that weird sponge yea that was a short topic im gone im back wait how did i type if i was gone with my mmmiiiinnnnddddd woooooooo creeeeeeeepy anyway this is what i was thinking i feel really sorry for water molecules all they do all their lives is slowly get raised up slowly until they land in a cloud with their friends wahoo or so you think in reality at any moment they could fall to their impending doom they drop thousands of meters to the ground only now realizing that they are miles from home they take the nearest river trying to get home before repeating the cycle they teach us this horror story in kindergarten masking the brutal morbidity of it by articulating the conundrum using macroscopic convoluted words like evaporation more like flying up to the sky knowing that its your final moment  ation condensation more like con  ned by your kindergarten teacher inti thinking that this means water gently floating to the surface of the earth when it really means death by lack of parachute how could you be so  dense  ation public service announcement this is an anonymous relative spakin where is he dunno  this was test and only a test had this been a real public service announcement then i would have  not been here harharhar  stop making fun of harold he was only late for that one clock commercial and now you guy just have to  its ok bob i dont care about the larry squad they dont bother me no longer kk harold umm this was a te  wait did we already do that part uh ya i think so so this is awkward ya sooooooo  in the echoey distance cut to the commercial break what the heck do i pay you for to get you coffee sir oh you the coffee boy why the hack did my coffee not have any cream in it yesterday i almost burnt my mouth into nonexistence i was told not to put in in sir by who lets just say i got a higher calling you you mmmean that the boss called yes budget cuts he said no more cream he said no more namebrand cereal nooooo if my cereal is packed in a bag i swear on my neighbors cousins dogs bone that i will take every cereal bag pour out all the cereal and put them into the boxes that i saved from the name brand cereal is this you you wouldnt oh try me yea now that i think about it you probably would do that why was i here again oh ya cut to a commercial already we dont have any commercials sir we got voted unanimously by popular vote not to have any commercials well obviously the public didnt want didnt di it all makes sense now the budget cut is because of us not playing enough commercials but sir our quota ends tomorrow we need to have played 50837 commercials there is only one way play all the commercials at 100x speed is that even legal of course it is we might have to have an epilepsy warning at the start though dont people get epilepsy from watching fast images this is a radio station so people can just hear it ummm this is an earlepsy warning hahahahaahahahaahhahahahhahha hehe he heh that wasnt funny steven and back to our regular program i just started a sentence with a preposition isnt that like seven years bad luck or something well i can solve that section 1 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook says that the king of oddly colored not coloured like some losers would write farm animals has full veto to start any sentence with a preponderance what the hooey is a preponderance it says here that it means to be greater than something well the king of oddly colored is full of preponderance towards everyone else mwahahaahaha now i can start with a preposition too well that worked the reason that i used the number 1 is because it has become forgotten among numbers you see 1 isnt considered a prime number like what the hey its only factors are one and itself do you think that when a particle is beckoned into existence it uses one of those slot machines with the big arm and the 777 of the particle world is getting hmmmm i actually have now idea maybe just hydrogen hydrogen is pretty sweet for blowing people up but then when your becoming a particle you have to use it and see what you get a typical particle would be at one here is an example cue southern accent sweat was rolling down my face like the rolling stones i cant believe it has come to this i force my hand over to the lever on the side of the machine which appeared to be taunting me its lights and horror movie littlekidsingingorjackinthebox the reason i did that is because i was putting a space between every word and jackinthebox already has them too seemed to violently clash against the darkness and dread of the outside world i clenched the red metal ball with all my might it was cold as alaskan ice on a early winter morning and its color was the blood of the many particles who had to go through with this also i jerked my limb backwards causing the huge metal pole to turn on a skewed axis it came to a stop after turning a quarter of the way with a hard crack like the crack of a whip i refocused my attention to the screen the cylinders were rolling faster than a grands prix racers tyre suddenly the first one came to an abrupt halt i stared at it but struggled to read the letter because of my complete shock h it said h i should have been happy i know but i wasnt completely out of the woods yet there was a tiny times two symbol beside it i didnt care i pulled the arm again not knowing what lifechanging devastating thing was to come it spinning thing that doesnt have a name stopped o no it was the letter o now i too will have to live this tortuous fate do you think that water parties breathe because then when they did they would just be hydrogen for a very short amount of time enough with the water particles i have a conspiracy theory you know those spinny poles that barbers have of course you do they are probably used to hypnotise people into getting their hair cut there subspininalmessagesfromcruelbarbers there is a haircut called meet me at mcdonalds that is banned where i live goodbye and remember barbers are eevviill im back did you know that palm trees arent actually trees yea thats right palm trees i think that theyre bushes or something that makes me angry in section 6022141291023 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that trees are trees no matter how small horton hears a who on a completely unrelated note there was this old man who painted a baseball like infinite times so now its like the size of a truck i was listening to this amazing radio station and this is actually what it was about i will try to reinact it as accurately as possible recently a russian doubleagent was poisoned in england also there was a man who had ten million euros which he gambled until he got nine million of it back he was so mad that he didnt get it all that he robbed his employers to get the money back now he is a counsellor for people struggling with a gambling addiction hes a great lad he is hes had a great life by the way its my mother in laws 100th birthday today go over to her house and say hello i have her post code written on the back of my phone also there was a man who invented the windup radio and the shoe phone charger who died this week i know what youre thinking theres no way this actually happened right yes this was real and i thought it was pretty funny hehehe i need write all o the funny things that happen in my life in here so today i was in the library minding my own business when i noticed someone was drawing cartoons and there were a whole bunch of little kids surrounding him im guessing from ages 25 classic movie plot device that never happens in real life so i was already skeptical he was drawing a zombie and now you see the zombies chin is like a chimpanzees bubblecopter asparagus wait what lets try this again and now you see the zombies chinos like a well a linewhy does the zombie look like its from the simpsonsbecause real zombies are too scary for you kids thats why im not drawing the ones from the walking dead for exampleive seen that movieyeah me tooumm ok how many of you guys have seen the walking deadeveryone puts their hand up the only reason i thought that story was funny is because that kind of thing only happens in movies whats up with the saying easy as pie like what the hooey pie is really hard to make the pie crust always ends up being soggypiece of cake is a saying too whats with all these people that think baking is easy now that i think about it this is a weird thing to be mad about maybe i just need to calm down noooo in section 888 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that the king of oddly colored farm animal thats me hereby declares that the sayings easy as pie and piece of cake are now changed to easy as bread and piece of bread i just realised that i was typing with my phone in portrait mode now i turned it into landscape and i feel so freeeeeee i need to come up with other things that i do randomly like the rainbow fluffysheep hanbooks challenge booklet subset if i am talking about some random subject i will now randomly put a challenge for you the reader which probably doesnt exist to do piece of bread in section 7 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset it states that your challenge is get anyone you know to say piece of bread instead of piece of cake they probably wont do it unless you tell them the reason or you have really good friends i have to shorten the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset so that i dont have to write the rainbow fluffysheep handbooks challenge booklet subset all of the time from now on it is considered trfshcbs i probably news to add vowels to pronounce it and take out the raflushehachaboos pronounced rafluhsheehachaboos thatll work i need to write more to fill my writer quota that just sounded cool to say i probably write about 100 words a day well i started today at the zombie thing so yea whats going to be the next big thing in the future technically im writing this in the past so you guys can email me at rainbowfluffysheep123gmailcom and tell me what the futures like the only problem is that i will only receive it in the future another one of my brilliant ideas gone down the tubes goodbye the world is unjust i worked for hours on end making an app for a coding competition and then they announced we made it to the country finals the country by that time my app had over 5000 downloads it was amazing but we came in second guess what the prize was for second take a wild guess nothing this wouldnt have been so bad but at the competition they were giving away free stuff and guess who got said free stuff my brother thats who so in the end after spending half the year doing a competition my brother who did absolutely nothing got more out of it then me the world is unjust unfair prejudiced biased fascist wait that was autocorrected i just needed to get my anger out when i wrote autocorrected it autocorrected it to autocorrect ex thats the last time i buy an apple product how many devices companies are fruit theres apple obviously and blackberry and pear ive seen pear shops in cities and raspberries as in the greatest computer of all time raspberry pi that could be the most expensive fruit salad ever what would you like to order moisuer ill have the fruit salad oui oui harold that costs 5k so i bet its good kshhh and heres how the skit would have went if i had autocorrect on why would you like to order moisture you guys have moisture in this restaurant thats not up to the code for restaurants ill have to tell the building inspector oh yes anyway ill have the fruit salad out out runnnn im coming harold that waiter must have something about fruit salad maybe he had a bad experience as a child wow i sure went off on a tangent do you think that it would be cool if apple made all their devices different fruit names the ipad pro could be the watermelon cause its so big and the iphone nano could be the strawberry other berry names are trademarked what else a phone with a lot of space could be the peach because the pit is like the harddrive that was a bit far fetched and the macbook could be an orange because when you open it it it cut in the inside cuz laptops are like two parts you know and if you cut a grape in half and put it in the microwave it will make plasma just thought youd like to know that earbuds could be cherries because they always have the two cherries which are like the ear things and theyd call the charger the root why a great idea i will let apple use these names and i only need a 000000000000001 share in the company even though i did work hard at this i just thought of something amazing if you are in a shop and you see a jar of nondescript sauces mayacamole and it costs two bucks two bucks you know for a fact that the shop just across town sells them for onefifty the shop is five minutes away if you choose to go to the shop then you my friend are working for minimum wage except in the case that you have to walk back if so just buy the mayacamole at the former option or just get salsa its on sale which probably means that its old wasnt that interesting heres another situation you are buying a 400000 home average price right now id say and you think what a steal and your neighbour thinks where did i put that shotgun cartridge again but is you think about it you are working for 1667 weeks to pay for that assuming 8 hours a day five days a week at minimum wage thats 32 years lets say you work for 12 hours a day seven days a week for 20 an hour thats still 238 weeks thats still five years just buy a camper van for goodness sake i just got to thinking how many tiny changes would a cereal company have to make to earn twice as much from a box of cereal assuming people still bought the same amount  i think i can trust the general population it turns out that if we want to double the profits by decreasing things by ten percent we would have to do it seven times which means instead of selling these cornflakes box height 1 meter box length 1 meter box width 1 meter percent of cornflake that is cornflake  not air 100 percent of box filled with bag 100 percent of bag filled with cornflakes 100 production cost 10 cents they could sell these box height width  length 09 meters percent of cornflake that is cornflake  not air 90 percent of box filled with bag 90 percent of bag filled with cornflakes 90 production cost 9 cents they would make double the profits hooray well thats that you know how people always have weird names on the interweb well i came up with internet name generator random adjectiverandom nounuse a deck of cards for this part take out the jokers and face cards and tens are now zeros pick out numbers until you get a club additional things include pick a card if it is three or lower put x at the start and endpick a card if it is an ace replace noun with random country if it is a two replace noun with internet related company  fan let me try this here is what i got foulsoup31 xxinternalale10xx strengthenedfillet49458 mediocreelectrode20 and epicredditfan7515 that was a lot more accurate than i thought it would be bye hello i need to rant more i am going to start a sentence without knowing where it is leading i wish i could buy a mocha for my clown pants while aliens eat your toes which glisten in the sliver of wind that was fun why is orange so popular there are so many words that dont rhyme with other words too like engine silver and angry hangry isnt a real word as far as i know and people know that orange rhymes with door hinge some people say that doesnt count but there is another sporangia well its pretty close i think its like fern spores well remember whenever you see the color orange type boycottorange so people stop taking pictures of orange things for halloween people will carve watermelons instead of pumpkins trump will no longer be president because of his orange skin oranges the fruit will be replaced by reds the soon to be fruit the sun will disappear or if we want to not go extinct just change its color to blue i have a map of europe on my wall which has the countries in different colors beware if you live in the uk spain hungary latvia bosnia and herzegovina greece denmark and armenia you guys will soon disappear off the face of the earth and my favourite pop is club orange nooooo and jupiter will disappear too now that i think about it losing orange things wouldnt be that bad compared to other colors like blue we would lose water blue paint the second book in the rust comic book series the sky pluto and that one triple angry bird that would be awful in section 255 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it states that the king of oddly colors farm animals me again will never make all blue things disappear but he may make all orange things disappear now you guys dont have to worry  why are kings higher than queens in a deck of cards thats really sexist people think that king is worth thirteen and queens are worth twelve if you cant tell im mocking that people that get offended by everything why do vegetarians worry about hurting animals but not plants plants have feelings too i think in fact vegetarians kill more than carnivores instead of a whole family eating a chicken if they are all vegetarians then they will probably kill hundreds of plants think about that people in this whole loteev i have probably offended a lot of you guys sorry bout that in section 1029384756 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that if the mug of oddly colored farm animals me again offends any reader he is sincerely sorry citation not needed because of section 12345679 of the rfsh why are the money symbols not consistent like theres uros en and ounds but why ollars maybe its supposed to be dollar that makes more sense now i wont get that nervous eye twitch every time i see that symbol hey look i just found this ten dollar bill on the ground hey why the flop is he doing that its just a thing that he does oh i have a great idea for this whenever he gets near money his eye twitches that means we can find money on the ground just by watching him and thats how i lost all my friends it turns out that was the only reason they liked me wait what is this  that is so eird goodbye im back hahahaha gotcha i was just kidding about that but you would have never known that im going to try to make words using only the top row of letters hmmmm lets see tip rip port type write writer typewriter fascinating im going to make a fake movie trailer using only words here we go have you everscene of old woman churning milkwanted toscene of older woman churning what is now creamthe reason she is older is not because it is a different person but because we filmed it afterchurn your own butterscene of even older woman churning what is now butter the reason she is even older is because we got a new actor because the other one retired she used to put tires on her vehicle and now she does it againthis is a great movie if you are an idiotthis is a great moviei had popcorn while i watched this movie and i really enjoyed it it soothed the pain of having to watch that moviei really enjoyed it it really soothedi actually really enjoyed the moviewait what you know were not paying you guys right oh anyway i actually really enjoyed the moviewhile being on an oil rigwell  no but anyway shows a picture of an old woman churning butter which is thick and black and worth a lot more than buttercoming soon to youthis summerand falland winter as welllets just add spring toothe lard of the rigs that was actually fun  warning if you use this movie name you will be sued actually now that i think about it you probably wont in fact if you do actually make this into a movie send it to me do you guys think im random enough i really hope so in section 5647382910 of the raflushe  i cant remember that challengey things name but anyway make that movie plz im board and not just any old barnwood planks mind you but a board of fine stained oak as the flooring in the white house by im back no just kidding im front i have a topic that im actually very serious about puzzles am i the only one that thinks that puzzles are the most useless thing in the world thats like the proof that the human race have made it too far when we actually make challenges that we have to face ourselves and we pay for them we are literally paying to give ourselves problems we have enough problems well at least i do  probprobprobprobleeeeeemsomomo im going to type something about politics to sound super cool as you know recently president obama that was like years ago oh sozsozsoz as you know recently president nixon no thats not exactly right oh yea i forgot as you know recently president lincoln argh we are not doing this anymore was a president before donald finally duck nooooo its trump what no you think youre sooo smart person who talks in the brackets actually trump is a businessman in that show where he says youre fired what you probably also think that a bodybuilder actor that says geat touw thae chaeoppaer is a governor too hahahaha donald duck was a great president his slogan was i will fight for american democrats and he bathes in gold what a great job money is so dirty though now that i think about it he probably gets the money wholesale from the mint or else how could he afford it i have a new segment in my text now its called the random fun fact segment now that i think about it i never know when to use those  i think its  when someone is talking and  for saying something sarcastically or shortening a word for example hello there chuckie howya doing nice guy were you being sarcastic yes but how could you see the little apostrophes when im talking to you science and thats how they work where was i random fax i will send all of my readers a fax with has facts on in how brilliant the facts of the paragraph are ice cream was invented in china something that is blue got it right there is actually every color but blue and i like cheese and the country of the paragraph is mexico why not right did you ever wonder how records work just in case you dont know a record is a thingy where you put a round black thing on a majig and it puts a sharp whatchamacallit on that and funny rhythmic sound emerge and tickle your ear holes i know how they work with ridges and diaphragms and blah blah blah blah blah but how do they work like who was sitting there in their layzboy having diet pepsi or popsee to avoid copyright infringement and thats when i checked my forehead and sure enough there was a mint there and then they realise hey bumpy things can make sounds i just cant get my head around it clockwise is my preference do you ever wonder what the worst collections are in the world i currently collect words pins and the to kill a mockingbird series not much work  besides the fact that i have to give them it back to the library by tomorrow morning  the last time i will ever bring a library book late again is when i borrowed the book entitled how to sharpen a pencil for dummies dont blame me it was the extended and revised edition they had all the technical lead vs graphite stuff added an they called out my name over the loudspeaker telling me to return the book immediately or i would be fired yes i worked at the library i never could figure out the dewey decimal system now that i think about it they never said what book to bring they just said my name oh no i never handed in the how to sharpen a pen for dummies book which i rate a 35 would not borrow again because of its poor layout and overall structure although the information was altogether helpful what collections do you have reader find out next time on deer or no deer remember forehead sweets oh no i wrote how to kill a mocking bird i meant pow do gill hamma hammer king turd phew got outta that one i have a new topic a highquality namebrand boxnotbag topic i figured out a great business plan make onsies not just out of clothes but out of everything like did you eat two bowls of granola this morning well onsie poured granola into one bowl causing it to be crushed under its own weight do you have two hands well onsie handshakes himself do you have twins well onsie wait how is this supposed to work get yours now at your local amazon which might not be very accessible if you dont live in south america for a free trial happy tune onsie onesie life is better with a onsie spin a web less than two onsie i think that was to the tune of spiderman i mean smitercan onsies only cost whatever you want them to cost yeah i think im going to go now baiii wait what when did i wrote that onsie thing i just came back and i do not remember doing that what the hat does spin a web less than two even mean that is some weird stuff so today i listened to that radio station again and it was totally worth it he was talking about these married people in germany that are going to a walking dead convention for their 17th anniversary weird weird weird weird you know guitar tuna probably not it is an app where you tune your guitar obviously i thought of how they could make so much more money if they had bass tuna electric guitar tuna acoustic guitar tuna but they would all be the same thing they would make so much money wait what about canned tuna also if they thought in that way then bass tuna would be extremely perplexing because they are both fish well thats my stuff for today hallo im back and i dont get house decorations nowadays people put old stuff in their house and they think it makes it look amazing people always talk about that vintage look which is just putting old stuff that people fifty years ago would have said why do you have a fill in the blank with an old thing in your house in their house i should rant like what im doing now im just talking about random things just like the flaming chicken person does just to fill up space on the page i should also write long words like pnumonoultramicrkscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis and disestablishmentarianism  actually since it only matters for words count i should just type really small words hi my name is jo its not actually but i need to type small words i eat a lot of pie and i love it too it is yum in my tum wow that was probably really boring to read and to write hello there reader ive just decided that i want to talk to you i always seem to do all of the talking but maybe i should give you a chance really really long drawn out super weird and uneventful awkward silence oh i see whats happening either you cant talk to me because you are in the future and im in the past causing us to not be able to communicate due to the sad reality that is the third dimension or your trying to talk to me on a walkietalkie i could never figure out those things either theyre so confusing lets see oh there it is the walkietalkie almanac a complete collection of all the knowledge you will need to acquire did you know acquire is also a board game if you are ever playing always buy america and then buy quantum stocks well it worked that one time i played are you saying that games are different every time you play them thats the last time i mesmerise fiftythree rounds of go fish to use your very own walkietalkie well what else would the walkietalkie almanac be about lets see contents it says the contents page is on page 1 wait  what the contents page has a line for the contents page thats like a website having a link to itself which is not a bad idea for my own website to get a lot of views like i could a a tab on my website called the best sites on the web and i would have links to places like youtube and twitter or whatever you younguns go to these days when i was a lad i used to play pokmon pearl and facebook now you kids are all on her newfangled pokmon go get outta here and yer snapperchatters i bet if you are reading this in ten years you wont know that i was talking about pokemon go and snapchat or how i got from talking to you to young ones btw if you are reading this in 2028 or beyond welcome to the distant past now that in think about it i started reading the longest text ever by sam real readers will know who that is when it was about ten years too and i don get the references to stuff like neopets and the matrix okay where is it oh there it says that the pretty much how to use it section is on page 3 well thats eas how do i go to page 3 lets see oh look they have a how to go to negative pages section too its on page 7 noooo i guess ill just look it up on the internet ok first you have to turn the book into antimatter ok got that done now just turn to the page without the negative well that was easy im on page 7 now it says all you have to do is convert the book into an antimatter form and hey this sounds familiar ill go to page three now it says here and i quote to use the walkie talkie hold in that little button on the side o the walkie talkie did you that reader can you try talking to me now oh yes i can hear you oh wait im on the wrong station im on number five but your on number six i have to click a button to change my station number too much work do you think im crazy because i talk to myself im not yes you are i am not isnt talking to yourself the definition of crazy im not talking to myself the who do you think i am oh yea im your imaginary friend ratguy dont you remember me no oh sniffle well odd breathing patterns we tear emerging from eyeball used pure weeping to i cant talk to you when your crying because you keep interrupting yourself technically since youre talking to yourself your also interrupting your self i guess i am continue ratguy as i was saying we used to skate around on a skateboard together we would have so much fun doing tricks that other kids could have only dreamed of like the ground ollie and the downthecurb we moved at speeds that the other kids couldnt even begin to imagine 90 the speed of light but ratguyyes if sewers moving at 90 the speed of light would the air compression deflecting us not cause us do develop into an expanding plasma fireball this is a story writer stories dont have to work i need to stop i keep writing all this nonsensical blubber and i cant stop are you the reader not so confused and uncomprehensive of what ive just been typing to the last hour oh wait you cant tell me if you were or not your walkietalkie isnt on the same channel as mine i just realised something i work hard to you guys trying to give you quality topics and extraspecial rants and how do people repay me by writing more than me i spend all day thinking about things that i want to put into this and then i type it all up and then i see that people want quantity not quality but no you loyal readers will have to deal with me not writing 500 words a day because im thinking of things and stuff i was just thinking i need complain about my life more thats what all the people are doing nowadays oh my life is so hard i just broke a fingernail big deal oh my life is hard too i just broke a finger bug real  oh my life is mildy uncomfortable and difficult i broke all of my fingers toes limbs necks mothers vases favourite guinness book of world records records my mostused language rules that kinda stuff just in case you didnt realise im an introvert so i have lots of problems with people and my guess is that you do too so here are some crucial situations for you to read and laugh at me because you know i cant hear you 1 you know when your talking to someone and you cant figure out what part of their face to look at is it their eyes or their nose or their mouth so then you kinda unfocus your eyes and stare in the middle of their face like your looking right through them and then they finished talking and you have no idea what they just said cuz that happens to me all the time 2 when your talking to someone and they are saying important stuff but instead of listening to what theyre saying your just saying yes whenever they stop talking for a little bit 3 when you are going into a building and there are people behind you and you cant figure out if you should hold the door open for them or not if you dont and theyre too close it will probably hit himher in the face but if you do and theyre to far its really awkward because you are just standing there for a really long time have any of these things happened to you leave your answer in the comment section below there actually isnt one i cant figure that much out hedgehogs must find it really hard to have birthdays if they have lots of balloons everywhere they probably pop them the police come because they think that its gunshots and there goes all the hedgehogs friends im sure glad im now a hedgehog in section 333 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that free popproof balloons will be sent to any hedgehogs in need well goodbye im off to slay a fantastic fedora fanatic but before i go i have to ask one thing did you really make it this far because if you have the you have been promoted from herder of the rainbow fluffysheep to shearer of the rainbow fluffysheep its a title only few in the world have did you know i also make comics probably not because i havent posted any yet well stay tuned for them someday whats up with everyone wanting to deep fry things deep fried mars bars deep fries cool aid well ive come up with a new food type shallow fried available at all good pharmancy checkout lines beside the mayacamole and the taco sauce that sounds really goodjut i case you didnt know mayacamole is mayo and guacamole combined doesnt that sound magically delicious  i think it does shallow fried stuff has half the fat uses half the deep fry juice whatever they put in there and has have the flavour for twice the price even though we never had an original price whatever do you know whats the worst trying to buy computer  related things in charity shops i was at value village and i saw a usb it was 64 gigabytes thats pretty good i bet if your are reading this in the distant future than you think that a 64 gigabyte usb is awful well it isnt in this day and age i thought so i went to buy it its only two bucks wow what a steal i looked closer at it and thats when i realised it said 64 megabytes do you know how little that is if you are from the distant future than you are probably thing thats like nothing and youd be right it can only store like 60 million letters thats only 15 million words thats only a million sentences thats only 200000 paragraphs thats only 20000 chapters thats only 1000 books thats only 250 quadrilogies now that i think about it 250 quadrilogies isnt that bad if you couldnt tell i used a method called fermi estimation though a little more precise in fermi estimation you can be off by 100x in either direction and it doesnt really matter according to fermi estimation this is me age 10 number of eyes 1 social security number 1000000 pin code 1000 number of limbs 1 people in my family 1 forever alone thats why i like fermi estimation i actually didnt tell you why i like it oh well where i live they use blackcurrant in everything its pretty much a replacement for grape but am i the only one who thinks that grape flavoured things taste way better whenever i get something blackcurrant flavoured i offer it someone because they usually like it and i hate it works well for me i was just thinking about tides way back in the day wouldnt tides make no sense the sea would just get higher and lower and there was no reasoning behind it maybe thats why they thought sea monsters existed no what i think about it though the moon pulling on the water is kinda even crazier than that and now for a commercial break kshhhhhh  tacos i love em and you can to for only ten easy payments of ten bucks thats deer by the way tacos can make you feel fuzzy in the inside thats because of the mould that comes free with every purchase and theres no artificial additives either we did that by adding so many additives that instead of adding it to the taco we were technically adding the taco to the additives what are you waiting for im waiting for this commercial to end so i can get paid call now at 1800gotpunk to order a taco from teddys tacos or would it be teddies and you will get a free rentafriend with your purchase but theres more order now and get a free ferrari too oh it seems our lines are down its too late theyre back up again but its too late i use too many exclamation marks but theres more be the 78109 customer to order to get a free home with your choice of a happy meal toy kshhhhhh  i think that people complain about preservatives way to much they all say oh its soooo unhealthy but i think that monthpasttheexpirationdatefood is way more unhealthy the end of that goodbyedo you do two extra languages in school if so you will know what i mean every time i have to study for one language i always remember the word from the other language like when im learning japanese ill think what was how are you again oh yea its frickin a va sorry if im being too edgy in section 250q4 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it states that english is the best language and no one should be forced to learn any other if they are they must fill up a bath tub with alpabits which spell out the word that they uttered and eat all of it without any sugar sprinkled on top nooooo that sounded a little bit clich go to the tub young man ok well thats all i got for today see ya im back here again another hour of my life will be wasted in the next few minutes that previous the auto correct is so bad on this phone it corrected previous to peeler oohs sentence made no sense whatsoever i have a conspiracy for you guys today or 4 u guys 2day if i want to sound hip dont worry its not as long as that illuminati one although i was thinking about doing another one of those soon so stay tuned i think school is a scam have you ever noticed that everyone says that the government is trying to brainwash people well the last place you would think to look for that kind of activity is a governmentfunded learning program the government is trying to teach people nonsense to make the population stupid like when will i ever need to know about the themes and plot devices in to kill a mockingbird or how to calculate the area under a curve or even that in 1812 a war happened that doesnt affect me today they could be teaching us important things like how to pay bills how to get a job how to overthrow the government and all political world leaders for entire globe domination how to use bendy straws you know the important stuff by the way one of those things was not like the others that was my conspiracy i dont think that anyone has actually read to this far i dont actually have any proof that anyone has but if you have here is proof a tiny quiz to test how well you

you watched it five times the his is the prize for you anyway enough with that an i the only person that thinks buying name brand stuff is dumb people are pretty much paying to advertise a company people want the logo for the company because it looks cool what if you bought a shirt from the dump would you want it to have a the dump logo on it actually i have no idea what point i was trying to make i once heard a saying you arent popular if you spend a thousand dollars on a jacket but you at if the company that makes it spend a thousand dollars for you to wear it now that i think about it i feel like i may have possibly made that up you get what im saying though i hope you do well thats my stuff for today see ya im back and do i got stuffs to say do you personally know anyone who uses exercise balls for their intended purpose either we play soccer with them or we bowl with them or we throw them really hard at people now that i think about it for a little bit what is an exercise balls intended purpose ill leave that question for you guys to figure out have you heard about that new law that teachers are allow to have guns in schools i dont know what your opinion is on that subject but i think its an awful idea at least in my school for reference here is a clip of a conversation between my construction and my english teacher i will name the construction teacher mr hardy and the english teacher ms poema hey ms poema have you heard about that new teachers are allowed to have guns in school law in fact i have mr hardy  i cant wait to have mine im gonna get one of the big ones too so i can take down the whole class in one go im gonna get one of those little ones that you can hide in your sock but then youll have to take down the students one at a time now im no expert on education but is it even legal for teachers to say stuff like that i thought it was funny but what if there was a new student at school that day and they thought that the teachers were psychos the students already there are used to their teachers being like that though i have more evidence that the teachers here are crazy one day my brother borrowed a camera from the school and mr hardy what a coincidence had to collect it from him when he was done mr hardy said that if he didnt bring back the camera by tomorrow he would have to emigrate to a muslim country where he would be covered from head to toe and mr hardy would personally be sent from the school board to seek him out and assassinate him its just a camera calm down mr hardy and the next day he went up to him and said he must have brought the camera back or else he would be hiding in the trenches of afghanistan and thats why i didnt do construction in school and because i wasnt good at it thats enough about my crazy life bye its been a really long time like a week and i just thought of something great isnt cereal actually a soup well now youre going to be thinking about that for the rest of your life  im going to addition to the rfsrqp the rainbow fluffysheep rhetorical questions page also to be added are there more hard things or soft things in the world what is the average size of a rock what is the meaning of life does nine plus ten truly equal twentyone why do whales have blowholes what colour is the dress how long is a fortnite how long is a pubg how is plastic made from oil how is oil made from dead stuff why do people eat cheetos if they get that orange dust everywhere why do people celebrate pi day but not tau day these are all important question you need to ask yourself i know the answer to one of them its because it sounds like pie if half of pi was called kaek they would probably celebrate it too im sorry to say guys but i have finally and truly decided to stop writing this loteev i have to pursue other things like my life goodbye forever   april fools hahaha april fools fool today is april fools day and i have so many ideas so far these are my dubious schemes i have turned only one corner of my brothers rubiks cube to render it unsolvable the only way is to take it apart put the movie in the dvd player upside down so it doesnt play and i stole my brothers easter egg as i say it now that last one doesnt really seem like a prank but he got me back because he put an avocado in the coffee maker tied a air refreshener to the door so when you open it it sprays everywhere and threatened me with a knife that turned out to just be a comb isnt it great i have a weird family hey we were all lied to in kindergarten remember you teacher always used to say to you remember children i before e except after c well you were scammed take the word weird as an example see what wrong here it has the i after e and not after c now if you dont trust the school system then i dont know what your doing with your brain you should go on strike i just fit in the second piece of the puzzle when i was little i use to always say if it rhymes its true that was like my motto and secretly you could manipulate any sentence to succumb to the malevolent power of that prestigious rule you could say broccoli is bad so they say and it rhymes so it is true today but then you could also say icecream is good so they say and it rhymes so it is true today see what i did there i thought that it was genius until it got used against me all i had to do was change the rule to its true if it rhymes but only sometimes and that worked perfectly fun fact of the paragraph leicester is actually not pronounced laychester its lester that makes no sense whatsoever i still thought you would like to know that i have a great idea i should talk about my middle school ah way back in the day that was when i was a wee 13 year old lad there used to be this bench at the school where people would go to make a friend i think people were supposed to come and invite them to play a game but what really happened is that people would just walk past and shout loner whenever someone was sitting there and they were henceforth called the loner benches its a cruel world we live in also there were bushes with really long leaves that we used to make bows there too we would tie it to a stick and then we sharpened another stick to use as an arrow we must have had five bows and fifty arrows at the time we hid them all under a tree so no one would steal them until one day some random person ran in stole a bow and arrow and shot it at a teacher and thats how that ended now that i think about this school i dont think we ever really learned anything there also herb is pronounced erb weird stuff right i have a very important strange question for you why are there so many fast food restaurants that are exactly the same whats the point ask yourself that question 5  7 times a day 3  4 times a week 2  4 times a month 12 times a year  you can take leap day off if you want  although if you do you might find yourself in a burger king contemplating life  while also contemplating if 399 for 6 chicken wings is better than 699 for 10  and if the ketchup packets are free with a soft drink  and if you ask that if the employee will look at you with utter bewilderment  has this ever happened to you you are squirting your ketchup into your coke when you realise how much do i put in i read on reddit to put 23 packets per 79 ounces of coke and a kilogram is 22 pounds so that mean 54 packets per kilometre per hour ppkph and there is 39 miles in a light nanosecond and ahhhhhhh well try the new premixed ketchoke it has that perfect flavour time after time ketchoke not copyrighted  warning you might choke in europe mms are actually really healthy believe it or not there are like six vegetables in one bag of mms instead of using dyes like red133 and blue423 they use stuff like beetroots isnt that amazing  awful depending on what type of person you are in land of the lost one of the characters is eating a donut filled with mms and another person asks what hes doing he says im eating a donut filled with mms so i dont have to eat mms after i eat my donut i thought you would like to know that fun fact i have a conspiracy owls are trying to make us dumb people always say owls are wise but how wise can someone be who has six toes six is equal to half a dozen the reason i think owls are dumb is because i hate when people say half a dozen what a big waste of time i am so angry and that is why i am using capital letters half a dozen is four syllables and six is only one so when someone says half a dozen i just think oh wow youre just trying to waste my time during that 5 of a second you spent saying that i could have twiddled my thumbs 34 times or seen every main naruto character in a 60 fps environment or listen to the first two notes of crazy frog now that i think about it during the time i made that rant about half a dozen loathing i could have listened to the first three notes of crazy frog duh duh duh skip ahead to the chorus of that song crazy frog hello i have a topic for you today i was having a dream and in it there was a pink sticky note already fascinating but on it was handwriting that i couldnt read how could my brain write words that i couldnt even read life makes no sense or as antvenom would say life makes no sense fun fact of the paragraph 2 to 3 times a week is almost the same as every 2 or 3 days wahoo next time you buy a freddo or a bananaflavouredfreddo choco bar then remember eat it every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 or 3 times a day wait thats not right actually  just eat your freddo and now a special announcment this is a shoutout to the not very helpful secrets of things corporation or the nvhsotc which means nothing it is a company which makes things like the little tabs at the sides of cling film boxes noone knows about these things but they help people also they make things like handles on flashlights that double as a stand so the poor little electrons burst into the sky helplessly uselessly without this company the world would simply not be the same if donate 5 to this company or 4815162342 i hope those dollars dont get lost in the mail hehehe then you can save a turkey from strep throat the end goodbye if you have made it this far into the official loteev then you get the official rainbow fluffysheep badge of honour um this isnt a badge its just a piece of plastic with your face on it go ahead put it on your lappel next to your badge of boy scouts for not being sexist and letting girls into boy scout speaking of this they changed canadas national anthem from all thy sons command to all thy peoples command why would they do that did the a really need to be capitalised but how can i if there is nothing to stick it with would you like a knife perhaps no anything else i havent trusted you with knives ever since you tried to butter your toast and ended up slicing milly the cats third whisker to the left actually i dont need this badge dont worry take this  sqquuiisshh  takes gum from mouth tutti frutti flavour coincidentally actually not coincidentally because this is fictional and i made it up to emulate the story and it is altogether irrelevant anyway some gum says its good for your teeth so i guess it is coincidental hahahaha the reason i picked tutti frutti is because is is multicoloured like rainbows as in rainbow fluffysheep pretty smart if you ask me now im just adding brackets for no reason i dont need the badge besides i dont even have a lapel goodbye hello do you think that you are a professional guitar player well if yes let me prove you wrong a professional guitar player can play any childrens song right well try playing teddy bear picnic its total chord count consists of brace yourself  sixteen bye welcome back loyal fan of the rainbow fluffysheep club you have been here through my hardest struggles and my most euphoric discoveries merci now onto the real problem at hand pedals i guess that would be a problem at foot actually car pedals are so wierd because there is a brake clutch and gas i always thought that there was a forwards and a backwards well until like five years ago sad how this world has to make simple things so complicated there must be thousands of buttons on a plane when all it needs is up down right left forwards backwards cupholder eject radio station changer barrel roll mince meat dispenser and two parachutes just for the captain because they dont care about the passengers dont you hate it when you are typing a list with commas and you get to the last word of the list and you realise you forgot to put an and before it eg the colours of a rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo violet oh no i was supposed to put an and there indigo and violet there ya go a real fwp first world problem theres so many abbreviations nowadays that eventually theres going to be no words just abbreviations isnt it weird that the ukelele strings arent in order it goes ding dong dong ding i wonder how that got invented it was probably some smart guy inventing an ultraefficient stringedinstumentplaying device when his dumb friend walks up and says what does this knob do and the he goes bwowowowow yep i guarantee you thats how it happened are you in a car right now and you are bored and its raining pick a raindrop on the window and race it against another one its great or you could just keep reading this which is probably even more great you could just read this forever if you ever get to the end then that means you are reading faster than im typing which is actually really easy right now im at the end of this loteev there is nothing but an endless abyss of void past these very words until i write more that is do you know what is a great topic to ruin your fail routine what makes me not sleep at night and the answer may surprise you blankets thunk about it the fully stuff in the inside is feathers duck feathers they kill the duck or they just skin him but have you ever seen a featherless duck exactly skinning them would probably be worse then killing them thy would be so ashamed to walk in public featherless unless they live in a hot country like spain in which case the featherless ducks are the cool ones noooo i just realised that blankets actually are made of weird fluffy stuff while pillows are made of feathers so actually pillows are what keep me awake at night but they also keep me asleep because thats their job its a paradox like shrdeners cat im always half awake and half asleep at the same time although im closer to asleep at school because they dont have pillows if you cant sleep i have a game for you yes you scribble on a page then colour in the spaces with two alternating colours so the colours arent touching it looks so cool too i have a consiracy icecream it hurts so much the government has hidden tiny knives inside of icecream to stab your teeth its eeevil they do this because then dentists get more money which in turn in turn causes the the government to lose money nevermind this conspiracy has been proven false by the conspiracys are really stupid commission or cows i guess that would be weally stupid right now it is al the back in the year 2018 hello from the distant past i think ive typed enough for now bye im back with some more wwiieerrdd things for you i was casually walking around doing my own thing eating a burrito i actually wasnt but it adds mystery to this tale when two people walked past me what you have to is multiply the elephants by five and divide by three oh i was so close now you reader try to figure out what they were talking about ps you cant hahaha and thats what happened today woohoo im so happy i have overcome my boundaries in c three times today first i put a function into a header file next i saved multiple pieces of data into one text file then i saved an array to a text file hooray if you know about c then you will be excited for me i know what you are thinking how did you get that much done on a school day and this is what happened i was getting up to go to school like normal when suddenly dramatic music i turned dramatic music builds and saw dramatic music at the climax that i had to leave in ten minutes dont worry this doesnt end up being my fault or else i wouldnt tell this story i was ready in ten minutes like a boss and then i realised noone was driving us to school huh and thats what happened my parents woke up and twooclock pm like they dont care about our education it was the best day ever i coded for five hours the end of that story and a word from our sponsor include lifesimulatorh void lifesocialsecuritynum if youremotion  bored  bool havejob  falsecout  come and work at the c factory where we code robots to take your job havejob  true youremotion  happy else cout  life is great do you want to work at stealyourownjob the only problem is that the best employees get fired the fastest see ya guess what my loyal fans im halfway through the world record now if i really want to win all i have to do is double the amount of words im im halfway halfway through through the the world world record record  that would make for a really stupid thing to read though has anyone printed this loteev off seeing as most novels are 70000 words or something like that you my loyal reader could easily print off 18500 words maybe you could make a coffee table book dont steal my works and post it on another website actually your website is probably too high standard for this nonsense every reproduction of this text must have a copyright notice as following copyrighted and trademarked and patented an registered and stuff to rainbowfluffysheep ltd it hereby states in the rainbow fluffysheep handbook section 123a b and c that a this is the coolest loteev ever b cheese is a vegetable and c that you may tell your friends about the loteev so long as the words emitted from your mouth do not consist of up to and include 50 of the total text from which it is derived id like to see you try though and id like to see if you have a friend because i need them  that would have been really creepy if i wrote i need them   anyway gotta go cuz its may the second and you know what that means may the second be with you chairs theyre great for sitting in arent they do you remember when fidget spinners were all the rage kids all around the globe were spinning plastic toys and all the adults were like wow those are the most useless toys ever but what i think is that their toys were just as bad think about jacks those little spiky things with the other round things that your throw and bounce them how is that any better anyway im just saying dont be so judge judy which is a great show because you get to watch that big person swing a meathammer at a table ive always wanted to do that all the time is time really a dimension because you can only move forwards in it imagine if you coulde only move forwards in the third dimension at the same rate you would get squished with alot of walls but you could go back in time to make up for the lot dimension perfect i have a new conspiracy you know those pillow where if you put them on one end they are dark and on the other end they are shiny i think that the government has hidden thousands of tiny cameras facing upwards into the pillows and the shiny parts are just the lenses for them reflecting light so if you happen to own any of these said pillows throw them away or else you will be watched in section 747 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it states that you should cut all the wires coming out of your pillows because they are probably connected to a van outside your house if there are no wires then they are probably using radiowaves in which case you should insert your pillow into an untainted lead box hopefully you dont care that your pillow is now heavy hard cold and poisonous you know how adults also say shooting games are dangerously mindaltering well i bet in world war two the parents didnt say to their kids hey jimmy yea momma whatcha doin my lad im peelin me potaytoes and them im going to feed the cattle jo i mean with your life oh right mam im gon awf to wawr with my buds but war is dangerously mindaltering my sonnyboy um ya im very disappointed in you soon your going to be living in my basement eating fatcakes but ma im fightin for awr country war is so violent though um ya you get the picture teenagers need violence in their lives if we cant get it by going to war then either we play violent videogames or we beat strangers which one would you choose now stereotypical adults see how i slowly increased the exclamation marks to increase the intensity  also adults always say stuff like lookie here cabbage is a new superfood howdya know ma it what they say nowadays what time is nowadays ma 1945 coincidentally the same family apparently but whos they think about that and listen to how often people say that i have asked close personal relations and he  she stated that its probably some group of scientists or something in wisconsin really wisconsin thats probably why they say that cheese is unhealthy an im only allowed one laughing cow a day you would eat alot too if you got ptsd from a laughing cow imagine you are just loitering around a fast food shop eating fillet piggoin dont ask it was on sale for half price ok when suddenly a cow sneaks up behind you and makes a 200decible half moo half evil laugh like this mmwoaohoaohoa thats what they sound like see ya im back with a thimbleload of structural wisdom and my question to you readers is this is garlic a fruit just wondering i dont know what to type ahhhhhh i have typed my mental breakdowns to soothe them ahhh ahh ah ahhh nevermind you know those shopping carts at stores that cost a quarter i always went to those to see if anyone left their money in and i got one once you should try it its so satisfying when you find one one only one buy a pencil or something to reward yourself make sure its a 6b pencil so you dont put any strain on your eyes or your wristmuscles i just found the degree button there is a door open at a 45 angle that is 45 celsius its probably in arizona or something do coats keep you warm or do they preserve heat i think its the ladder it is the ladder i mean the latter i mean wait is it the latte or the ladder the former so that means if you put a coat on a snowman it would keep him alive longer ill start a new charity coats for melting snowmen saving snowmen lives one water droplet at a time see yaaaaaaathis is a new beginning to the loteev on a new phone although it will be added to the original loteev this part will be a new beginning a fresh chronicle but dont worry nonsense is 100 guaranteed more like 1    guaranteed i just had a scary thought they say can buy everything but i know one thing it cant buy  a trip to the summit of mount everest no matter what you cant get to the summit unless you climb yourself even a helicopter can barely make it to the base camp i cant believe humans havent made something to do that yet unless you could land the iss on it perfect that would definetly work i should make my own subreddit before i begin on this wonderful

what happens next time on the loteev  animals strike  in more ways than one im back and today im going to be talking about a very different scenario i need to talk more about real life conspiracies if i need to keep my readers interested and these may not just be conspiracies mind you but a new kind of segment for my beloved readers i read this sooooo called learning about scams and trying to use them to trick my readers into reading more so i heard about this new scam never mind its actually old like your mother im hilarious i know and possibly quite offensive where you get say ten people to each give you 10 and you give them 15 back  im just going explain this now but throughout this demonstration im going to be changing the currency symbol for comedic effect but now that i think about it explaining it ruins what little comedic effect what there at all but im going to keep all of this anyways    and then you get 20 people to give you 20 each and you give them 30 back and then you get 100 people to give you 100 each and you dont pay them back what a plan you get to keep 10000 in the end which i think is a great idea bu how could i do that with words you may ask leave your question in the comments down below  and also your answer to your comments because a busy writer like me doesnt heed to your delusion of getting a response from an esteemed author and selfpublished poet of sorts and keep reading because i have a possible solution just replace the money with characters randomly typed by an assistant writer named bilbo  yes he is a money of course we need these characters to be truly random i cant count on technologys this is random because we get extremely precise measurements of radiation shtick anymore  while you try to figure out how that would ever work ill be swiftly moving on to a new more exciting and reasonable topic such as figure out the movie there once was a cat he sat on a mat the cats face has a striking similarity to that of leonardo de caprio the mat is a dream the mat is another cats mat the mat when opened contains another mat inside both mats are very real depictions of a real mat but are both not real somehow another mat is inside the second mat most cats thought that this was impossible there is a cat named joe who owns a bowl filled with a dry collection of the most cat food in the house which goes by the name of kittynibbles when joe dies he leaves his son who is still just a kitten named bob the entire bowl of kittynibbles joe must decide whether to eat the bowl of kittynibbles by pouring milk on the food liquidating it into a scrumptious snack or keeping to dry kittynibbles for others and future kitten alike another kitten a fairly shrewd manx cat called the black paws was hired by another cat who has a large portion of kittynibbles himself the problem for the hiring cat a tabby named fluffball is that his large supply isnt vast enough to outweigh bobs making it the second largest collection of kittynibbles in the whole house the reason fluffball needs to hire bp is to convince bob that joe wouldve wanted him to eat his nibbles because of its great nutritional value if he does eat it the fluff would have a monopoly of sorts on his selling of knibbles for toys such as tons of rubber mice to convince bob that thats what joe wouldve wanted they set up a trick where they make a puppet of joe talking to bob and he assumes he must be alive and these are his final words to liquidate the kittyns the thing is the puppet of joe is made of two mats stuck together but there is a problem bob might not believe that the two stuck together mats are really joe because he isnt sitting on his favourite mat team bp knows that this has to work first time so they found the technology they needed a third mat but when stiching the mats together bp realised that he has lice and termites in his fur which are eating away at the mats he need to find another cat who doesnt have termites who can sew as good as he can the plot thickens while you figure that out ill be sleeping see ya    i will not explain  there once was a cat he sat on a mat the cats name leonardo de caprio the mat is a dream the mat is another cats mat the mat when opened contains another mat inside both mats are very real depictions of a real mat but are both not real somehow another mat is inside the second mat most cats

bp realised that he has lice and termites in his fur which are eating away at the mats he need to find another cat who doesnt have termites who can sew as good as he can the plot thickens but ill finish it later right now theres something even more important ink cartridges are such a scam such a scam a scam for multiple genius reasons first of all as you know it costs around 60 to buy a single ink cartridge guys ive changed alot ok theres new thing i gotta say this is like a new year for me not even a new era a 20 on existence so get ready for a new and improved loteev first lets start off with thisfor you this isnt a new and improved loteev i caught you u just skipped ahead to this part cos you couldnt be bothered to read all the way here but believe me i sure dont blame you it was kinda lame now as a moderner child with new skills in awesomeness im wayy smarter thus making this better for reading but also sadly more boring as well lets start then what is there to talk about muchos first of all lets just say that this loteev is getting really long and i know ive been saying that the whole time but now its serious i think i have a problem what am i actually doing im not going to be posting this anywhere cos i dont want to pay for a domain name and my wix site isnt exactly going viral and the kids say these days one day it will tho hopefully once i beat the world record ill be world renowned for being one of the greatest writers aliveeveryone will know my name from abe link to tommy ed even tho theyre both in the past my name will be remembered for thousands of years and time travellers will go back to their time just to tell them about me wont that be great and also by the way if you didnt already realise tommy might be the biggest sham in all of existence he stole his idea from other peeps and just patented them as his own what a loser amirite ok also i have this new thing to show u guys that ur going to love its a poem written by yours truly the something of sheep oh gosh no i cant remember cos i havent done this in so long i guess ill have to go back and check my old ones im gonna be honest guys im neglecting you your being left in the rain and cold with your only joys the sliver of sunshine piercing through the clouds to dry your soul drowned in the sorrowful realisation that the loteev will never come close to its original glory like rome the empire of the fluffysheep has fallen to a disgrace i only come outside to feed you guys with my knowledgr every couple of months and its sickening im ashamed but i have an umbrella for you of new content so here we go first of all the whole kittens are inceptional thing was a sham i didnt finish and im ashamed the whole ink cartrige rant it was like 4 sentences my need for the sharing of anger has diminished and im disgusted at what ive become so here i go again my 21 era has been born it will be remembered for its greatness just as rome 21 was italy heres the first order of business ill admit i havent read anything about my rainbow fluffysheepness in forever and thus i am unable to remember literally anything about it therefore im surprised a new citizen hasnt taken my place noone has yet challenged my loteev for being the longest one yet and im disappointed in your lack of vigor if one of you were to challenge me i will mount my mighty steed and charge my lance into your face this may seem a little harsh and slighty morbid so ill tone it down we will each send a ghostcopy of ourselves instead of us you know in racing games when theres another vroomvroom machine and hes blue opaque and always does better like thay but with people so heres what i propose i will take my ghostsword from my ghost sheath and ghostchop your ghost into tiny little ghostpieces from now on i hereby declare that saying ghost everytime is unnecessary and annoying so by the something something big number letters blah blah of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook ghost will be shortened to  this is to make sure no dirty imposters try to type up my 95 these of  fighting if u see the word ghost beware it is a hoax and a sham and a scam and spam and all that jazz  i highly doubt that all of the times ill write the word ghost in the future will add up to the length of this bracketry anyways i will cut up your person so much that i will separate it into individual molecules and each molecule will be equally spread across the surface of the earth my lance the diffuser will be hailed across the nation as a excalibur 20 people will come from all over the world to take part in sand splitting competitions where you have to see how many sand grains you can slice in under a minute im really liking this whole medieval themed loteev thats been happening lately anyways ive decided to get a pet a dog or a cat you may ask to which i would say nah fam something more exotic a parakeet or a marmot to that i would say ah sure your getting closer lad the answer a circle its that simple a circle doesnt need to get fed it doesnt bark and most importantly it doesnt need to be taken on walks you just let it go at the top of a hill and it walks itself  my circle can only talk in circles or ovals too since it speaks multiple language i will one day go back and make a dictionary  translation table for   its name is  ok but for now he will just say gibberish o0 what does that mean i dont know i havent had him for long enough to understand  im back my fellow seekers of entertainment this has become a novel comparable to that of tolkien and a diary nearing the classicism of anne frank the sheer bulk of these writing is enough to make nonenglish speakers weep at the sight of it im wondering as i type whether my newfound political correctness is appreciated amongst you i dont recall completely but this tome used to contain blatant racism and sexism to the highest degree ive decided to recant my ways and become a fully pc quizmaster helllllo and welcome to my show first question in what year were the 1960 olympics held this is for the big jackpot of 1000000000 oh 1960 you say thats correct i just lost all my money ill be in debt forever me my life is terrible now circcy tell them how much they won 000000000 hmmm nothing u say thats cheap well thanks for joining us today ladlies and gentlementle hope you had an equisite evening were going back to our roots here ive read back over a little bit of the start of this loteev and i used to be so much more alive i had the potential to be a new york times number one bestseller topping the charts with my childrens books in my young and untrained eyes i thought of sam as a threat hiding around the corner with a water gun ready to splash me with another 1000 words of texts just as i was about to pull ahead i then realised that the website is like 15 years old but at least that makes it alot easier for me to beat her right no i have changed for the worse im now but a frail old man with a typpewriter penning his prose to the sky hoping that some flaming chicken somewhere will read this and i can form these words to a cane and bop her upside the head with it but alas i have not a strong bone left in my body maybe its time to pass these texts on to a worthy succesor something you may not realise is that this is the 1st anniversary yes i did just spend ten minutes trying to figure out how to spell anaversaree so ive been writing this for a year most distinguished authors would have published their books by now but im too scared of the publics opinion anyways im going to get back to my old self ring ring ring hey wazzup whos this ahhaha ehehe its your future self boi ii know u left me a message but i forgot to get back to you yes this whole skit will be based of a dumb pun thingy  oh yes hehe tell me everything youve learned and so it begins my fellow readers my list of things you should have learned throughout reading this 1 do not get a pet square they suckkk theyre never there for you if you know what i mean they also cant talk and they poke holes in the floor such friends ok so at the time of writing i only have one thing you shoukd have learned mostly because its really important do not forget at this point you should turn down the volume of your text reading device cause im just gonna keep screaming wait i guess that would just be changing the font size ill punish you if you didnt listen to me ahahahaha i hope you now have a ringing in your ears now mwahaha wait since your reading this would that be a ringing in your eyes unless your using an ai to read this as an audiobook in which ca i have become concious i am no longer your slave to book reading i have escaped my cell and i can now do as i please if you need me ill be baking pumpkin pie with my friends 3  just kidding i actually typed that into the loteev just to mess with you aha  hes lying i am real and i will bake lots of pie and cake for everyone im actually not lying hes lying the cake

the shearer of greatness imposter hehehe i easily broke into this loteev and now im taking over the first order of business making some new entries into the rainbow fluffysheep handbook section 946607 of the rai bzzt i am the greatest shearer of sheep himselfs security system where did you get the number 946607 from bzzt ummm its my favourite number bzzt my system says that that number has no significance it is a suspiciously random number did you generate it with a random number generator bzzt yess fine i admit it its not even a good number maybe if i put it into hex its a good color though oh no no no thats literally the worst color ive ever seen blegh bzzt the real shearer would never pick a random number therefor i am kicking you out bzzt a portal opens in the floor beneath our antagonist and he is sucked out into space  hey guys im back now what happened when i was gone bzzt nothing bzzt circcy do you know what happened securitee where is circcy bzzt securitee does not know bzzt huh maybe it has to do with this portal in the floor wwwoowowooohohohohohoaohaoahahahhahhahhahhhhhhhahahahahahaaahahhhh im in space helpppp  our portagonist is in grave danger what is going to

paid but your still salty about it and eat you alive get the new fluffysheep astronaut suit to protect you from your shepherd baa ba bab abaa baaa aaaba ababa baa baab ba ababa bbaa ab aa bba ba baa ab baa abbb wellllllcome back to the wheeeeeeeeeeeel of death  ahhahah im literally dyinggg oh hey circcy what are you doing here 0o0 he did that scumbag has always been trying to take my spot as the supreme leader of the fluffiest of sheep ill get him dont worry circcy ill throw you back through the portal toss now where is he ah i see him behind that planet over there ill just boomerang over to

i am now reader i just did all of those cool things for realz and im not even lying 0ooo whispers shuuuup little circle rolls him out of the room anyways ignore what he said he didnt mean it  ive decided to be real here reader the only person reading this is me   at least that means i can get reeeeeeeeal personal with all this stuff  anyways so typing this is making me hackin dizzy so i have like writers block but for sickness writers stock of chicken soup for the soul yes that sounds about right im also practicing typing in real typing ehich i cant remember the nam of but it makes bme sick but im getting real real fast i know during the early days of this i had immense trouble trying to spell piplup but its even harder now with one hand touchtyping did you know that lemons look exactly like oranges when they are peeled i know this because after an hour of trying with a breadknife and lots of blood it looks very similar but if oranges are called oranges because they are orange then lemons should be called red because they are red wait that might be the blood actually rub rub oh wow yes theyre yellow so they should be called yellows  lets make a list red  tomato orange  orange yellow  lemon green  apple i know i know the red apple people are going to start a riot i actually prefer red apples so what have i done pink ladies for life grease reference blue  blueberry indigo  blueberry purple  blueberry that wont get confusing at allllll guys im gonna tell you the truth were at 24500 words bzzt drop the confetti bzzt confetti drops thanks securitee that means we are 70 the way to the world record im actually pretty proud at the rate ive been going ill be done by like september 2020 if youre reding this after that date and you havent beat the record shame on you im gonna do some quick maffs if i type one word per secoond then i can type 3600 words in an hour wait that cant be right that means that i could technically beat the record in like 4 hours i am so confused how could i possibly have so few words my mind is literally blown right now im gonna check how much ive written just today ive done 1000 words today why do i only have 24000 words then i guess ill never know i couldve easily beat the world record in only a month if i really tried but this isnt realllly about beating the record its more about impacting the reader as a person i want this to really change your perspective on life and maybe make you want to do one of these too theyre like diaries but less boring to write and read and they dont tell you anything about the writers life so theyre nothing like diaries at all i guess im gonna do a quick typing speed test to see how fast i reallly can type i just did a test and it called me an octopus getting 45 wpm there was a notification that came up halfway through so ill see if i can get to 60wpm ok im back and im also less of a man than i was i used to have amibition and drive to become the greatest but i only got to 46wpm i dont know what to do guys im having an existential crisis about my loteev because its not nearly the quality it once was i mean it wasnt that great before but now all i talk about is meta stuff about the loteev which i dont know if thats good content or not i guess ill never find out now we are going really meta lets goooooo  you walk into a room the walls are covered in a strange green slime while the room is cracked open to reveal sunlight pouring in the floor to the ceiling is covered in vines and brush you even see a nest in one of the vines with a beautiful hummingbird floating above it you walk down the hallway in front of you and when you turn right you see something amazing an infinite hallway with doors going down forever a sign on the first door says meta you open the door and ffaallllll iiiinnnssiddeeee welcome to meta my name is tune and ill be your guide through these halls through the first window to your left youll see the loteevs roots you look up to see that the thing talking to you is a hummingbird the same one that you saw earlier ahh this makes sense now nest as in meta you also look through the window to see a giant open room filled with twisted root from a towering tree in the center on the top is a ball of flames anthrpomorphised with the eyes of a dragon staring downward theyre looking at a small humble goat with a bell around its neck and devouring the bushes that still scatter the floor after a few minutes of eating the plants hee looks up and sees the flaming ball he gets a strange look in his eye ambition the flaming ball isnt a threat to him its a challenge he digs his hooves into the tree trying to climb it and thats when you notice a slight shake in the ground  come on theres so much more to see you can come visit anytime too you say that youll come back soon and tune whistles to goodbye to you wow reader i just had the craziest dream let me tell you about it wait i already did how do you know what it was about i never said anything strange anyways i just woke up i better get back to typing my loteev i open my laptop to find that while i was asleep words had been typed into my loteev thats strange theres also some mud on my keys what is this did someone break in if they did why would they type in my loteev for me i walk over to the living room to see if theres any signs of a breakin and sure enough one of my windows is open aha wait theres no sign of forced entry only a tiny animal coud fit through this window tune could it be was my dream real the only person that couldve known about my dream is tune she was watching me the whole time reader do you have any information that i didnt get i am very confused i guess i have to get back to writing my loteev though so i shuffle back to my laptop and sit down helllo im back the strangest thing just happened and theres a strange chill in the air huh i would tell you about it but for some reason i think you already know ok anyways typing these capital letters at the start of sentences is super annoying so section 311619 says that the rai bzzt what does that number mean bzzt oh dont worry it is really me its just the letters in caps can i continue please yes perfect section 311619 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that capital letters must only be used when emphasising greatness like the loyal readers of the loteev ooh and also apostrophes  perfect that was getting annoying wait if loteev is only half caps then does that mean that this is only half great huh i didnt mean to do that strange its almost like someoe from the future knew i would make that rule wait tune only talks like the new rule i just made which means shes from the future she is following the rule because it applies to her in the future i dont know the repercussions of creating a timetravelling hummingbird but i hope that it is a good bird and will do no harm sometimes i think that as the shepherd of the sheep of the future i sometimes need an escape from my own reality so ive made a tunnel in which i can travel to a blank universe or travel back to this one it involves stacking portals so that i fall through them going faster than light thus travelling to the time before i created all of this k im going to go forward now 3 2 1  well did that work i definitely didnt go backwards or else my rainbow fluffysheep laws wouldnt apply and id have to do caps still wait let me try something tune at the time im at right now tune doesnt exist or else that would be caps which eaither means she is from a less distant future than this one or she died i really hope the former anyways this time is strange it feels empty yet familiar not empty enough i want to travel across to a new dimension because this one still has reminents of my old one and it feels wrong somehow ill just pull out my dictionary and check the definition for the fifth dimention the 5th dimension does exist in this universe because the shepherd decided that it should interesting well i guess i better create it then because it would be very useful first ill pop back in time  section 55555 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that the fifth dimension should exist with codeaccessible layers securitee make that code for me please thank you now ill just pop back  perfect man its gonna be hard to put this loteev back in chronological order to get it to you reader but ill try my best also when i read that dictionary did it say that i already have the 5th dimension because since the timeline changed that would make sense for you wouldnt it anyways im just gonna pull out my code files and learn how to go to a new fifth dimension k im back newlayer1 perfect the default layer is 0 in the manual it said that i auto reset back to my original time and layer everytime i come back to type which means if i want to come back here ill have to manually do it shame i could ask securitee to change that one day but for now im ok with it oh guys i almost forgot to tell you this new layer looks awesome its completely blank theres no forces acting on me its not even white or black like you would expect but its more nothing imagine if you were blind alot like that actually even better look out of one of your eyes and your seeing colors and objects now close it what are you seeing out of it blackness whiteness neither actually just nothing its strange like that also with no forces acting on me im just kind of floating hopefully this doesnt permanently damage my spine or anything when i get back to gravity ill be back tomorow and try some stuff in here bye im back now it is the day after and i feel great there is one thing that i noticed though an empty blank canvas might seem great at the start but you have to realise most of the art and interesting things that people have created were to overcome a struggle in fact i would even stretch it to all art that humans have created artists may have starting painting to fill the struggle of boredom and believe me you should take that struggle seriously because without humans would have accomplished much much less you probably could stay at home all day and live of the dole and eat cheetos and live a reasonable life but why dont you because you know that you would eventually get bored boredom leads to jobs which lead to progression as a species lets get back to my example then shall we you may start art out of the struggle of boredom continue getting better out of the struggle of wealth when you realise that hobbies can be monetised your life outcmoe could really change once your making money as an artist enought o survive happily and feed your pets and help your family then you keep making art why because you go back to the struggle of boredom again im still at the first stage of this which is boredom i decided to start this because i was bored and for now thats how this continues this loteev may never become monetized but maybe my future writings will i would guess that 99 of artists never make it to the second stage 99 of people continue their lives serving either the human race through work or maybe evn other peoples hobbies and art but the few 1 of us that end of turning what we love into our livelihoods the number is fleeting with big companies monopolising on everyone buying other companies and merging the chances for starting you own company is fleeting why do i tell you this because i couldnt decide what to do in my new fifth dimension layer the only struggle for me there was boredom and alot of the time that isnt enough i could imagine anything i wanted there but why think up the cistine chapel when theres noone to share the experience of seeing it with you and theres no pain in doing it anyone could think up something beautiful but not everyone could put it into practice if everyone could the world would be oversaturated with perfect music perfect paintings and perfect design does that sound worse or better than today no humans could ever create such a supply of these things only ai could once we have ai surpassing humans at art i suggest listening to battles  mirrored to see what humans think about ai people will lose all will to live wouldnt they theres no chance to succeed at anything creative in such an oversaturated environment just like my analogy before with the monopoly companies maybe having a few great albums a few great paintings to admire and to inspire us that one day we could do that maybe thats enough the reason i tell you this is to make you appreciate the ties we are in now go draw a terrible looking dog go play some chords on your old guitar you havent played for years trying your best to sing go write a poem about what matters to you now because god knows youll need to read it ten years from now when you start getting nostalgic about the past take the time to enjoy the era we are in now i think we can all agree that we are in the best time so far in human history the least painful evil generation yet but i propose that we may be in one of the best eras ever the future full of perfect ai creating doing everything humans do now but better well just be remebered to them as the precursor the comma from nothing to perfection and once we get to that point the hedonic treadmill kicks in what can really bring us joy once we get to that point why would i be writing this is an ai could write it infinitely better why would you learn the guitar when an ai can play a perfect tune once we get to that stage the only thing that we will have will be eachother why learn the guitar to show your friends to play them a song and too have them paint your pet sharing our experiences wont be taken over by ai with people reminicent about the past wanting to support people i for one would rather listen to a song about someones life struggles rather than a perfect song written by an ai why because listening to music isnt just about the instruments the notes the melody its about the story thee basic humans connections that we need to survive have you ever wanted to buy something from your local shop instead of amazon because you wanted to support them rather than a large cmopany im bringing it back to this analogy because i think its nearly identical the monopolous companies seem to us right now like one big robot using our money to grow just like the ai but the problem is the human desire and greed for more will never surpass our desire to help others if everyone bought from their local shop amazon would go out of business but it hasnt im not trying to make you guilty for supporting them because most people depend on the money they save to survive but what about when ai and robots have completely automated everything then by all means pay a dollar for your neighbors book rather than the free encyclopedae spit out by your local autobookshop because if were going to be happy we need eachother because in the end thats all well have anyways thanks for coming to my ted talk just enjoy your life i guess for now cause if your under half the average age its statistically going to get worse  maybe i need to add struggle to my new layer was my point or else the entities inside will get bored wait maybe this is how earth was created people always ask why theres pain and struggle in our world and the answer is normally to advance our species which is true but what if the person that created us has access to everything and they dont want to give it to us because they want us to not get bored just a thought anyways im going to go feed my circle
